My gf and I decided to do a taste test of this and Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZED2M"">Kool-Aid Twists Blastin' Berry Cherry Unsweetened Soft Drink Mix, 0.17-Ounce Packets (Pack of 96)</a>).<br /><br />The Blastin' Berry Cherry has a richer darker color and tastes better too. We have now made a switch to the Blastin' Berry Cherry.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste."

He was so excited about the new food and didn't hesitate to scarf it down. He has never had much problem eating anything I buy him, but keeping his interest can be a bit of a problem. The food smells nice (for dog food), kinda earthy and natural. He is still interested in it after several weeks and his energy seems good. He is white and has a sensitive coat and this stuff does well to keep his coat shiny so far. I gave it four stars because it gives him gas (not fun for him or me) and he is not fully adjusted yet (some loose stools). I'm not sure if we will get it again."

White,1/1,5.0,1346803200,"Hot powder, EXCELLENT customer service.","The shipping of this product was above and beyond anything I have ever experienced or expected for that matter. It first arrived within about 4 days of ordering it, but unfortunately, was returned by the USPS because they could not find my mailbox? The mailbox is beside another mailbox that receives mail everyday, so I'm not sure how this happened. It happened two times in fact, over the span of about 2-3 weeks. But, lucky for me, Sonoran worked with me the whole time, keeping in touch every time the item was returned, and never charged me any extra for shipping! When I finally tasted the product, it was really something I had never experienced before. I've had Dave's, Blair's, and they sometimes include things like ""pepper extract"", which I've come to find out is sort of like mace, or a major component anyways. The flavor and aroma of this powder isn't smokey like habanero's, but sort of earthy, and doesn't smell all that hot. But when you taste it, it's a completely different story. I sampled just a pinch(no bigger than my pinky toenail) and started sweating. The heat builds, and stays for at least 5 minutes afterwards. I've mixed it in with hot sauces at my job, and it's amazing."

Maybe I'm a little hard on it because I'm like a champion bread maker.  I was almost destroyed when I figured out gluten was causing my psoriasis.  My bread turned out mishapen and like a brick.  Just super heavy, and like week old regular bread.  Kinda crumbly.  It takes like an hour and a half to finish cooking on the inside.  I guess gluten free bread is so bad, that this is the best we could come up with.  I must say it had a nicer aroma than the other bread I tried, but I just am not impressed.  I'm going to bake another loaf, and pray that I did something wrong the first time.  I don't mean to be a ""debbie downer"", but if this is the very best out there, and I've heard that it is, I may just be giving up sandwiches all together!  I hope your bread turns out better than mine.  Is there a way to repost a review if my next loaf turns out great?  Oh well... just don't be surprised if your first loaf is a disaster, because I'm a kitchen queen, and it was no good.  P.S.  I'm vegan and had to use an egg substitute.  Maybe the secret is in the eggs?"

These little nutmeg grinders are great and measure up. True, there might be some loss of aroma since the nutmeg is in chunks rather than whole, but I've found these grinders and the nutmeg they contain to be very flavorful -- and certainly much more so than the pre-ground nutmeg you get in shaker bottles.<br /><br />Be sure to store these in a dark cupboard, and if possible, don't store them too near the stove or other heat source, as that can degrade the quality of your herbs and spices pretty quickly. Open spice racks are pretty, but they can cause the herbs & spices to degrade faster. When I had a spice rack, I used to transfer any of my herbs and spices into dark spice containers to help keep some of the light out.<br /><br />I found these nutmeg grinders to be a great value and very convenient to use."

This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups."

She was a stray I found at our school.  She chews everything (leather shoes, her bother's ears...) and she is inqusitive so I began a search for the perfect toy for her.  We have tried toys that are for aggressive chewers, many only last a day!  If she can't get it started one of her brothers help her out.  She is smart and needs to think as she chews.  We came across the Tug-a-Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw-on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).  The first one I got for her, the cord was much more frayed on the inside so it took longer for her to get all the food. The reason why I had to purchase another Tug-a-Jug is she finally chewed through the rope."

I am sure I am not the first to make that joke, but hey, that commercial was a classic.  So now, I am trying International Coffees again, but this one is more seasonal and American then a trip to Paris.  It's more of a home for the holidays blend.<br /><br />I tried this coffee with water.  If I added what they told me to add, it seemed to weak, so I added another teaspoon or so.  I didn't find it too much to my liking.  Even when I added hot water to a cup with the powder sitting in the bottom, it wouldn't mix completely. But I then used milk and my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001RT2C4"">Aerolatte To Go, Milk Frother, Black</a> to mix up the powder.  What a difference.  Now it tastes like high quality hot chocolate you'd get at a decant cafe.  The mint taste is really nice and works well with milk.<br /><br />I would drink it this way all the time, as opposed to making it with water.  But I may froth the water and coffee to see if I like it better. I wish I could mix the powder up with a spoon and have it completely dissolve because part of the fun of the coffee is to see it create it's own foam on top, which is probably not in the natural order of things.  The Aerolatte blends the foam right into the cup, on that effect is gone.<br /><br />I give it five stars, because foamed up and completely mixed in warm milk (about 1 minute and 1/2 in the microwave, not boiling) it is fantastic.  Reminds me of my trip to the Alps and Fritz, my skiing instructor, but that is a whole other story! :)"

It is 17% fat (a healthy fat from cocoa butter, with no trans fats), 7% carbohydrates and less than 1% protein.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is so named because it contains milk in relatively tiny amounts compared to milk chocolate and somewhat less sugar. As a result of having less milk and sugar, the taste of dark chocolate is more bitter compared to milk chocolate, but it still tastes sweet, especially when sugar is the first ingredient listed on the label as for this candy. Ingredients are listed in the order of quantity of each in the product. Since there is more sugar than any other ingredient in this candy (as in most all candy other than ""sugar-free"" candy), that's why it tastes sweet. In addition, the juxtaposition of chocolate that is more than usually bitter with the sweetness of sugar makes for a really delicious combination of flavors.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is one of several types of commonly sold chocolate. Unsweetened baking chocolate is quite bitter and consists of cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Milk chocolate is highly sweetened chocolate that contains milk powder or condensed milk. The amount of milk it contains smoothes out the bitterness of the chocolate substantially. White chocolate contains sugar, milk and cocoa butter, but no dark, cocoa solids, and it is not bitter at all.<br /><br />Research has indicated the darker the chocolate the more protective of the heart and cardiovascular system it is. (This brand of chocolate is 60% cocoa, but some brands go as high as 85-87%). In particular, consuming a small bar of dark chocolate, such as one of these, has been shown to reduce blood pressure in people suffering from high blood pressure and to reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol by as much as 10 percent.<br /><br />The reason chocolate is healthy is because it is derived from a plant, the seed of the tropical cacao tree, which contains substances called flavonoids. Flavonoids are antioxidants which protect the body from the damage caused by free radicals. Flavonoids also produce nitric oxide, which lowers blood pressure and balances important hormones in the body.<br /><br />These bars are a good size for a daily ""dose"" of dark chocolate. However, if you wish to buy a ""giant economy size"" of this chocolate, it is also sold in 6.8 oz. bars carried by most supermarkets for as little as $2.50. This large size is divided into 8 individual blocks. A serving size is three blocks at 170 calories."

It is something natural for him to chew-on, and it  helps to keep tartar and plaque down.  I give it to him every 3 days or so.<br /><br />There is an odor to them when I open the bag to take one out.  When they are sealed in the bag, you can't smell them.  When the dog is chewing on it, you can't smell it.  And they don't leave residue on the carpet or furniture.<br /><br />They come in different sizes and quantities.  Here is a larger size: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MA04LY"">12"" BULLY STICKS - Large Select Thick - Dog Chew Treats, 12 inch (4 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a><br /><br />You can also buy these directly from DogStuff4u (which I did); just Google that name; they have free shipping too.

Plaque covered the surface of all of her back teeth.  While the plaque is not 100% gone, it is greatly improved, probably about 75% of it has been removed.  I'm hopeful that with continued use, it will get even better.  Also, this product does not give my dogs intestinal ""issues"" as other rawhide treats have done in the past.

However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

There is a good dose of B vitamins (about 40% RDA). Vitamin C is a natural stimulant for energy (100% RDA). Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, Folate, Biotin, and Pantothenic Acid are all at roughly 40% RDA.<br /><br />The bar has 290 calories, 70 calories from fat, and 180mg of sodium.

I first started drinking this tea because I wanted to start substituting green tea for coffee. So one day I ventured into my local Starbucks and order a green tea. The barista then served me up this wonderful cup of tea. Curious I read the label hanging out of the cup and began my mission to purchase some of this Zen tea. After a few misses I found a Tazo box at my local pharmacy Duane Reade (which is less of a drugstore and more of a supermarket). The tea that brewed was wonderful and flavorful, but I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. I mistakenly thought that the box of Tazo tea housed the sachets like those I had tried at Starbucks. I would later discover the `tins' (as I call them), which are sold locally at Starbucks (duh).<br /><br />In my opinion both the filter bag and the sachet taste strikingly similar. However, I still favor the sachets as they were my first experience with Tazo.<br /><br />Whoever is the Tea Master at Tazo is doing a superb job at keeping taste very consistent.<br /><br />I brew the Zen tea piping out and let it sit for a while longer than usual. I find that if I let it steep for to short I get too much lemon grass, as it takes a while for the green tea flavors to steep out. It's really an art to balance the complex flavors of this tea, yet well worth the mastery."

Inital try had many unpuffed  pieces, and the pieces that puffed, had rock hard ends.  Microwaves pretty much work by heating the water in your food, so if the amount of humidity in your pork rinds is too low, they won't heat up enough to puff.  I took about 1/4th of a paper towel, wet it and lightly squeezed out the excess so it was not dripping wet, then put it in the bag with the pork pellets overnight.  The next day, the paper towel was dry, so I guess that the rinds absorbed the extra moisture.  When I tried to cook them again, they puffed up much much better and in less time.  There were only two or three unpuffed pieces, and one or two rock hard ends.  I also got good results by soaking them in water right before microwaving, but the papertowel method is easier with less mess.  Just be carefull that you don't make the inside of the bag too humid then you may have to worry about spoilage."

182422,B008RWUKXK,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,Jason,10/10,5.0,1321142400,Tasty - A review from a health food novice,"I couldn't honestly care less about flax seeds and all the other mumbo jumbo on the packaging.  I guess I can just trust that it's all good stuff.  With a brand name like ""Kind"" it's a leap of faith I'm willing to take.  What I do know, however, is this stuff is tasty.<br /><br />The smell from the bag is earthy, with a little cinnamon, a little oat.  It reminded me of family drives as a kid when we used to roll down the windows while passing the Quaker Oats factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Very inviting.<br /><br />Smell is not sufficient, so I had to eat this bag of goodies.  VERY impressed.  One thing I hate about a lot of granola (oat clusters) is that it's crumbled too much.  You end up with thousands of tiny chunks.  This is not true with the Kind brand.  There are big and small chunks, with the right texture and crunch.  Added to that is a simply delicious flavor; it's like health-food candy.  Each bite is like cheating a diet.  Delicious cinnamon flavoring without being overpowering.  I highly recommend it in milk as a healthy alternative to sugary cereals, or in handfuls while hiking through multi-colored forest landscapes that pleasantly make time disappear."

Its very convenient and keeps all the cleanup contained in one bowl.<br /><br />Best feature - the food processor is _very_ powerful and I don't need to strain foods b/c there are no chunks (I do strain peas to remove shells after processing).<br /><br />The steamer is quick and efficient.  With the steamer basket full, I make about one-week worth of single-ingredient food at a time.  I peel foods and cut into chunks before I steam them.  Holds about 2 small sweet potatoes or two pears or one bag of frozen peas.<br /><br />I store foods frozen in silicone mini-muffin pans (much easier to remove than from an ice-cube tray).<br /><br />This device can be used to defrost food - just pop the frozen food in a small heat-proof bowl first.  But, unless you keep a close eye and check a few times, the food gets way too hot.  Easier to use the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir well to make sure there are no hot or cold spots.<br /><br />I will definitely use this when our baby starts to eat our food and it needs to be blenderized first.  The blade and motor on the food processor are fabulous and better than others we have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The price is way too expensive.  I received it as a gift, but would not have bought it for myself.<br />- The spatula is useless, a small silicone spatula is much better."

It's not a hard cheese but not exactly soft either; you can slice it, but it softens up a bit as it comes to room temperature.  Very pleasant texture.<br /><br />I think the flavor would go well with many things; so far I've had it just with flat rye bread, which tastes like a match made in Heaven.<br /><br />I also was very happy with the company's service.  The order shipped amazingly fast, was extremely well packaged in a cooler with ice packs, and the products were all fresh and chilled upon arrival.  The shipping cost was very reasonable too, especially considering the good pricing of the company's cheeses, and the high quality of the packaging materials used.  (Note that the per-cheese shipping cost which you see on the Amazon website can be a little confusing.  If you order several cheeses, like one probably would, the overall shipping is going to balance out.  For example, I ordered about six different cheeses from the same company, so the combined total shipping was only about $9; it's not $5-$6 per each cheese; I think that would only happen if you only ordered one cheese at a time.  Also, the Styrofoam cooler and many Cold-Packs they included in the packaging are something I can keep and re-use, so one gets more value for the shipping cost.)"

I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.

No sirens went off, the cats were still walking around and life appeared to go on, so I let my guard down and decided to take a breath while the noodles and I were in the same room.  Silly me, I thought to myself.  I've been fooled by the drama of Amazon reviewers.  Sure they do have a smell, but steaming up some brussels sprout will leave you worse off. A 30-second generous rinse of hot water in my favorite yellow Tupperware strainer yielded a healthy portion of stench-free noodles.  Then I decided to do what no man has dared to do before!

I prefer Gia Russa, Cento, and Don Pepino...no cheese in those sauces, so I suspect it is the cheese that I prefer OUT of the sauce.  You can always sprinkle some on the pizza to taste.  I also like that the other three brands are allergen free so I can use it safely for my granddaughter who has nut, egg and dairy allergies.

(Note: I didn't get it from Amazon, so this review has nothing to do with Amazon's distribution process, just the taste of this product.) I picked one up at the grocery store mostly because I was extremely curious how they have ""milk chocolate"" and ""peanut butter"" while also having ""0g sugar."" Peanuts have naturally occurring sugar in them (generally a few grams per serving), and milk chocolate usually contains large amounts of sugar as well (although it is not necessary by definition). Well, when I opened it there was a small amount of white powdery buildup on the outside of the bar, mostly on the vertical side of one end of the bar. I broke off a piece and the inside seemed a bit moist, which was reassuring. The bar is essentially a full solid (fairly thin) chocolate shell around a homogeneous filling of orange-colored peanut-smelling material. However, the bar tastes terrible. I got some cocoa flavors (_not_ chocolate) on the tongue to start, immediately followed by a very strange nutty flavor from the inside filling - I suppose it was peanuts, but wasn't clearly recognizable as such. What was recognizable, however, was the lack of sugar - it didn't taste even the slightest bit sweet. The aftertaste was extremely long (I had to get a drink to wash the taste out of my mouth after a while), and tasted bitter, sour, and a tiny bit salty. Not enjoyable at all.<br /><br />Again, others have been complaining that some bars taste significantly worse than others due to possible mis-handling during the shipping process, so your mileage may vary."

(So far I have tried the One a Day - yes the same as the vitamin maker.) I was hoping I would like this one since I didn't like the other kind.  So take this into consideration with my review.<br /><br />Instead of pouring the packet into a water bottle, I filled a Guinness pint glass about 3/4 of the way full and added some ice before adding the packet.  I wasn't really sure how much water was the appropriate amount to be mixed.  I was delighted by the hot pink foamy action at the top of the glass, but after stirring it around with a spoon, the foam quickly disappeared and the powder all dissolved into the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the powder all dissolves.  There is no junk left at the bottom of the glass.  The color is very bright pink - almost fuchsia.  It seems a little artificial to me, but I'm not sure if it's a natural color for the pomegranate.  The very first taste was really good.  After the first sip, however, I realized it was going to take a lot for me to drink the entire glass.  It might be easier to drink this while you're working out very hard and are super thirsty and are more apt to take big, quick gulps.  There's also a little bit of a funky smell to it when my nose enters the glass.  This may not be so much of an issue if you're drinking out of a water bottle where you nose doesn't catch much of a whiff.<br /><br />To give a fair review, I thought I'd let my seven year old taste this concoction.  Maybe I'm just too old for the overly sweet taste?  Verdict? Seven year old didn't like it either.  I won't be buying this in the future."

I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate ""liver spots""  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few ""liver"" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,"

The only problem has been that I often did not want or need to use 32-ounces of the stock (the size of most aseptic packaged soup stocks) at one time. Although once opened, these 32-ounce packages can stay usable for maybe 10 days after opening, I still found myself throwing the unused contents out. Wasteful.<br /><br />These individually packaged small (8-ounce) sizes allow you to make just enough for a serving or two (depending on appetite) without waste. (Yes, you're paying a bit more in a cost-per-ounce comparison, but this is about convenience and avoiding waste.)<br /><br />Since I'm always adding my own seasonings (in dried or fresh form), the base flavor is not that important. In fact, I prefer a ""neutral"" or blandish stock so that it doesn't dominate the soup I""m making. I'm not saying this stock is tasteless, but if you're not used to low-sodium stock you're not gonna like any brand of it. (I use store generic brands as well as Pacific which I find tasty enough to heat up alone and sip if needed, especially in the winter. But again this is a stock and the base for building something. Not something that has a pronounced ""taste/flavor"" of its own. You will however, know that it is chicken and not vegetable stock.)<br /><br />Since I use chicken stock to flavor a lot of other dishes (including sauteed  vegetables) instead of oils and butter, having small amounts available to use as needed is both convenient and cost-effective. (I would never use those horrible chicken boullion cubes and the only other alternative, a fairly tasty powdered mix from Vogue, is just too expensive in dry form and hard to find.)<br /><br />That the stock is organic is a big plus. That does matter to me.<br /><br />If you are not cooking for a crowd, but rather for one or two, and use chicken stock for soups or in other foods, these are something you'll want to keep on hand.<br /><br />FYI: They are hard to find in stock locally and are more expensive than amazon. It's another convenience and cost saver to be able to order them online."

But for anyone on a diet restricted in sodium or fat (or both, in my case), this product is a nice find. It adds both body and taste to many dishes I cook.  The only sodium is from the meat itself, so a whole can has fewer than 200 mg, about 1/10 the amount found in most canned broths.  There's no fat at all, so a can adds fewer than 30 calories to your receipe.

Only after a couple of nights, we noticed a considerable difference in behavior for Hayden.  Our dog usually gets wound up in the evening time and continually wants to play even right before we go to bed.  After giving Hayden six strips, which is the suggested amount for his body size, he became docile and even sleepy before our bed time.<br /><br />I usually don't believe the statements that most products like this claim, but I can say we have noticed a big difference.  Granted the effect is short term and can't be predicted for really young dogs or ""unfixed"" dogs (for comparison our dog Hayden weighs 85 lbs, is 6 years old, and has been fixed).<br /><br />These are the draw backs though.  1) This is an expensive way to treat large dogs EVERY DAY, so maybe not realistic for everyone.  2) The effects may only last a few hours, so overly exciteable dogs may be able to ""battle through"" the effects.  3) Flavor is very strong and very odd (lavender?) some pickier dogs could turn their noses up to the smell and flavor of these treats.<br /><br />Just a note - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014IUZZ2"">Dogswell Happy Heart Chicken Breast, Flax Seed & Taurine, 3-Count 16-Ounce Bags</a> seems to have the opposite effect on our dog.

I bought this culture to add to my existing sourdough starter (which IS sour) to make the flavor more complex but ended up instead keeping two separate starters, simply because this one is so good.  Newcomers to sourdough may be disappointed with the taste until they learn the proper techniques to achieve the type of bread flavor they want.<br /><br />To begin, ""sourdough"" refers not to the taste, but to the method, which uses wild yeast and bacteria to create a sponge to be used in place of commercial yeast.  This culture will do exactly that.  In three days, I had such an active starter that my bread rose quickly, even in a winter-temperature house.  The bread was creamy, with an excellent crumb, although, because the starter was brand new, it tasted like white bread with a little character, something I expected but which may surprise beginners.  This was my first test of the starter to make sure it worked properly.  And it did.  Perfectly.  If you are buying this starter as a natural leavening agent and not as a sour bread maker, then skip to the last two paragraphs of this review.<br /><br />Most people who consider buying this culture will want their bread to taste sour, as it does in San Francisco.  They are not looking for a yeast substitute.  If this describes you, read on.<br /><br />San Francisco sourdough bread, with its distinctive tang, requires certain steps to enhance yeast- and bacteria-based fermentation. Here are my tips for creating a more ""sour"" taste using this culture:  1. When keeping the starter at room temperature, feed it less frequently once it has become established.  The instructions suggest feeding once every 12 hours (two feedings a day), but I find that once every 24 hours creates a more sour tasting starter.  2. Leaving the starter in the refrigerator for a week, unfed, and then pulling it back out for one feeding, then a sponge feeding 24 hours later, improves the sourness.  3. The instructions tell you to throw out all but 1/4 cup between feedings or to use 1/4 cup from your refrigerated starter.  I keep/use at least one cup, sometimes two, and give it the same amount of ""food"" -- 1/2 cup water and slightly less than 1 cup flour.  Just make sure that the final sponge is rising correctly before you use it. Once you get to know your starter, you'll know how much food and time it needs to fully activate.  4. Allow the shaped loaves to rise in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24 hours to allow for more fermentation.  As the yeast and bacteria consume the available nutrients, the dough will get sticky from the alcohol by-products, so don't expect to handle it again.  5. If you are using a bread machine to knead the dough, use the French bread setting since that will lengthen the kneading/rising time, OR, if you are kneading by hand or mixer, complete two full risings.  6. Hot sourdough always tastes less sour than it will at room temperature.  Yes, it's difficult not to cut into the loaf right away, but try to let it cool to warm before serving.  If you always eat the bread hot out of the oven, without having leftovers, then you'll never taste the full tang.  7. If you only care about the tang and not about the rising power, check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155832156X"">The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook</a>.  Hensperger provides several recipes for starters and bread that are much cheaper than buying this culture.  The recipes use a combination of starter and commercial yeast, but they yield a nice sour bread.<br /><br />The key to sour bread is fermentation, so anything you can do to promote it will enhance the tang.  This includes stirring any hooch, or alcohol, back into the starter.<br /><br />Other tips for this culture:  never use chlorinated water and never store in a metal container.  I don't even use metal utensils, although this is probably overkill.  Supposedly, metal can both inhibit growth and discolor the starter.  Since sourdough starters improve over time, you can expect the flavor to improve with every passing week, provided that you care for it.  If you follow the instructions, you will have a thick starter, not as thick as a dough starter but not as liquid as a batter type.  Of course, you can make this into either type with different flour/water ratios.<br /><br />This starter arrives in dried, powdered form in a small packet.  It comes with can't-fail directions for reactivating and maintaining the starter.  You will need non-chlorinated water, unbleached flour, and a glass or plastic container that holds at least four cups.  (I use a glass Pyrex measuring cup so I can tell exactly how much starter I have.)  Plan on at least five days between first feeding and first loaf because you will need a highly active starter to properly leaven the bread.  You can revert to the 24-hour feedings once the starter rises substantially in the container.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I recently read that the lactobacillus part of the starter is what gives sourdough its tang.  The wild yeast gives the bread its rise and spring.  Lactobacilli thrive in colder temperatures (under 50 degrees F), so refrigeration may be essential to getting that sour taste, either during storage or rising. (Think of the average temperature of San Francisco!)  If you are using the starter for the first time or without storing it in the refrigerator, I highly recommend that you refrigerate the formed loaves overnight, then bring them up to room temperature for an hour or so before baking.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

We have had a 12 pack for over 6 months...the last two are going in the garbage, like tossing away a dollar bill. I'll stick to Dark Magic for a nice strong coffee.

The box itself is labeled as organic and non GMO but does not mention any of the food allergies mentioned on Amazon.  We are very disappointed about this and had actually opened the box and let her have one before we realized the problem.  She did enjoy the cookie, so apparently it tasted good to her.

525692,B001EO5QLE,A3TX9ZT9GUBG4,Linux User,2/3,3.0,1253404800,Maybe OK for coffee.,"Better than Milk - Rice (Vanilla) contains maltodextrin, a starchy substance, (made from rice in this case)  as its primary ingredient. After that there is sunflower oil, cane juice, maltodextrine (a bulking agent used in coffee creamers, dairy products, etc.)  and some other fairly harmless ingredients.  I am not a fan of precessed food, but  I am looking for a coffee creamer without hydrogenated oils or cow's milk.<br /><br />I would not consider this a healthy product to drink by the glass.  There is a lot of processing that goes into making this product. In addition, the sunflower oil is bound to be rancid after a couple of days on the shelf.  Rancid vegetable oil is very bad for your arteries.  I will store my open container in the refrigerator.<br /><br />For me, the rice powder is too sticky to bu useful as rice milk.  The sticky quality of this product would elicit my gag reflex eventually.<br /><br />For use in coffee, the taste isn't bad.  It is reminiscent of vanilla flavored powdered coffee creamer.  For people accustomed  to the taste of mucous products (Dairy),  it has a kind of ""snot"" substitute which sticks to your palette.  This is probably the attributes of the sunflower oil and maltodextrine. I would recommend using this sparingly in your coffee.  You can add a little powdered goat's milk in lieu of too much rice powder in order to keep the sweetness and stickiness to comfortable levels.<br /><br />The rice milk powder does not dissolve quickly in your coffee. (Neither does goat's milk powder.)  You will have to wait at least 5 minutes after you drop in the rice powder if you don't want to chew your coffee.  Stirring helps but does not dissolve the powder immediately.<br /><br />I found a couple of uses for the powder.  It is probably not the intended use.  The powder seems to improve the taste of chocolate soy ice cream substitute.  It also goes well in plain oatmeal with a little cinnamon.  Just add a tablespoon or two while you are cooking or heating the oatmeal and shake on some cinnamon.  Oatmeal is lumpy and sticky anyway so you can't tell that the rice powder is also lumpy and sticky.  The rice powder is sweet so if you are watching your sugar intake then you should keep this in mind.<br /><br />I don't think I will be buying the product again anytime soon.  There is probably better non-dairy coffee creamer waiting to be discovered."

We chose to switch them over to vegetarian cat food for two reasons: 1) both of us are ethical vegetarians, and 2) we could!<br /><br />We switched them using the same methods vets have recommended when undergoing any change in diet for felines--slowly mixing them together in differing proportions until all that they eat is the new kind of food.  In this way the cats do not undergo any kind of indigestion that might cause them to throw up (those with cats already will understand completely).<br /><br />But what was the surest sign that we were doing the right thing for our cats?  Even on the first day, and for everyday it was given to them after, they ignored the meat-based cat food, eating only the vegetable-based pieces from their bowl!  Everyday when I went to feed them in the morning, they would be waiting next to a bowl with meat-food detritus, staring impatiently for the vegetable goodness.<br /><br />As for their level of health, I have literally never known two cats to be sweeter or more active than these.  And I don't mean chaotic, but playful, pouncy, and sweet.  Is it all because of the food?  I can't say to 100% certainty.  But know this: when we got the kittens they were shy and scared, seemingly because both only have vision in their left eyes.  Now they are more daring than even the most normal of cats.<br /><br />All this and we don't have to participate in the inhumane practice of feeding waste animals to our companion friends!"

The 12 pack lets you try some popular flavors, and get to know the unit.  Some flavors are better than others - oddly enough , I thought the ""cola"" was least desireable.  The ""Diet Pink Grapefruit"" was outstanding - similar to Fresca. ""Orange"" was good, as was ""Root Beer"".<br /><br />The ""Energy"" flavor is VERY CLOSE to Red Bull, and is what I use most. When you try it, you will want to get a full size flavor bottle. If you happen to like the taste , and benefits of energy drinks, you will love this. When one does the math, this can be a real savings!<br /><br />SodaStream seems to be making more and more flavors, and recently inked a deal with Kraft for some of their well known flavors.<br /><br />I like the idea of having the sample packs available - if only for guests.  I would also note that the Amazon price is BETTER than what I saw today at a retailer best known as a sponsor for the Thanksgiving Day Parade!<br /><br />As others have noted, just 'snip' off the top of the sample packs, and add the flavor s l o w l y  to your carbonated bottle for best results.<br /><br />I figure if you are reading this, you already have a SodaStream, or are on the fence about getting one.

I'm pretty sure that means it makes up very little of the contents of the 15 lb. bag. PURINA claims the nutrition is 'balanced' and I am sure that in some objective way it is, but dogs are carnivores and a food that is mostly ground yellow corn isn't exactly what I'd call ideal.

I quickly cleaned out half of my refrigerator to make room for the 48 cans of IZZE.  Then a case of IZZE Clementine arrived. Finally, I received the sought-after Blackberry. The IZZEs were multiplying out of control.  The two new ones took up the rest of my refrigerator. There was no room for anything but IZZE. At my house, it has become all IZZE all the time.<br /><br />To the credit of IZZE, the ingredients of all their products are posted on the IZZE web site. The IZZEs have all natural ingredients, although the labeling indicates that the citrus varieties. e.g. Clementine and Grapefruit, contain Gum Arabic and Ester Gum. According to sources on the web, Gum Arabic is a purified natural vegetable gum obtained from the acacia tree that is used as a stabilizer/emulsifier.  Ester Gum is purified natural rosin from pine trees.  I suppose trees are natural.<br /><br />An interesting fact about the IZZEs is that for every type of IZZE, the fruit named on the front of the can does not correspond to the first-listed ingredient. Here is the IZZE code decoded: for Apple the main ingredient is White Grape, for Pomegranate it is Apple, for Clementine it is White Grape, for Grapefruit it is White Grape and for Blackberry it is White Grape.<br /><br />There is no caffeine in IZZE. The IZZE web site says that IZZE employees ride bikes to the local coffee shop. So you cannot live on IZZE alone! All of the IZZEs are fortified with vitamins, e.g., Vitamin B6, C, and Niacin. I am sure that the IZZE people anticipated the need for vitamins for people surviving on a diet consisting of IZZE and coffee.<br /><br />All of the IZZE flavors have their own character.  Some are weaker, others stronger.  In order of weak to strong for the four that I tried, I would arrange them as Apple, Clementine, Blackberry, and Pomegranate.  I prefer the more subtle flavors of Apple and Clementine. However, when I brought an assortment to a gathering of friends, all of the Pomegranate cans disappeared while the Apples remained untouched.  It is a matter of personal taste. People who are used to soda, which includes most people,  prefer the stronger Blackberry and Pomegranate. Juice people may like Apple or Clementine better. I give the Clementine 5 stars, the others 4 stars. All of the flavors are good. Which one you prefer is up to you."

When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over....  Unfortunately, when I actually made the coffee, it wasn't extremely flavorful, not was it as dark and rich as I would have hoped.  In fact, it taste a little more like nutty coffee flavored tea, which isn't bad, I love tea!  But if I was coffee, I usually want something that taste strong.  I have had plenty of non-expresso coffees that are rich and almost thick, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />  It is a good light coffee, I suppose if you don't want something too strong, maybe to have with some cookies or muffins at tea time (not a lot of Americans have tea time, but if you do...), it is a nice coffee for that, since it is not too overpowering, it works well in that way.<br /><br />  As long as, when you get this, you know its not a super rich, strong coffee, I think you will enjoy it, its just all about expectations.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy"

And, like all of Numi's teas, it is certified organic and that is very, very important to me.<br /><br />When I first opened the bag, I was intoxicated with the splendid mint aroma!  The leaves are indeed full leaf and not the ""dust"" one usually finds in the ordinary tea bag.  The color is rich and verdant.  The flavor when brewed is heavenly...the mint is fresh, sweet and lively.  The herbal effect is lovely...it soothes the tummy, aids digestion, calms the nerves, and lulls the senses.  I really love it and can always find the time in each day to enjoy a pot of my favorite mint tea!<br /><br />I recently acquired a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LNOPSG"">The Breville One-Touch Tea Maker</a> which is the perfect method for brewing loose tea.  I get the most excellent results this way in brewing Numi's loose leaf Moroccan Mint. Of course an electric tea kettle isn't necessary for brewing this fine tea but it certainly makes it easier and the Numi~Breville combination ensures perfection.<br /><br />In fact, I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this product!<br /><br />The loose leaf Morrocan Mint is an extraordinary value when purchased in bulk like this from Amazon.  I'm using one 16 oz bag and keep the other in the freezer until I need it.  The way I enjoy this lovely tea and my Breville tea kettle, I'm sure to be going through my 2 pounds of Numi Moroccan Mint loose leaf tea in no time.<br /><br />If you are a tea lover and appreciate high quality, organic loose leaf mint tea, do not hesitate to choose this one!"

Although it does not state it is human grade, it certainly appears that it is by sight and smell. Both appeared to have a cornstarch based ""gravy"" with shredded or diced white chicken meat and diced carrots. I took my cats gobbling it down that it was tasty. I was surprised all of them liked both flavors as 2 of my cats are rather finicky. This cat food reminds me of a similar product Whole Foods used to carry in their brand name that I bought on a clearance sale. I alternate buying dry and canned food by Castor & Pollux's (regular and organic), Natural Balance, AvoDern, and By Nature (regular and organic). I feed them regular canned during the week and organic canned food on the weekends. The only issue I have w/ this product is the price point. The brands previously listed range from 5.5 to 6.5 oz. (By Nature-only 12 6.5 cans) and none are watery. They cost the same per can or you could view it as almost half price since the weight is almost double. Since I'm feeding 5 cats approximately 3oz. canned per day and all the dry they can eat at about $2/oz., I try to be as cost effective as possible while only purchasing those high quality products which I also consider this cat food to be. If you read up on pet food in general, you will no longer purchase poor quality food such as Friskies, Iiams, Science Diet, Fancy Feast, etc. If you go to PETCO or Care A-Lot(they carry better brands than PetSmart) and read the ingredient list you will be shocked, appalled, and enlightened. Cats do not well tolerate wheat, corn or soy and NO pet should EVER be fed animal by-products (see pet food at About.com for more information). Since Amazon currently has a [...] coupon off of [...] purchase, I will likely go ahead and purchase the crab flavor and the mixed fish case. Keep in mind you should limit the amount of tuna fed to your cat as well as to your children and any adult (see FDA website for tuna cautions and listed safe fish to eat). I hope in the future Petite Cuisine produces a more cost effective 5-6 ounce can sold in a 24 can case."

The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me.

This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!"

For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste. Its not so bad that its undesirable, however, I'm sure that goes with having the ground micro-ground to produce your coffee as opposed to filtering through larger grounds to make coffee. I will say as for 'instant' coffee - this is one of the best I've had. Each flavor has a distinct aroma and taste. Doesn't quite replace a freshly brewed cup of coffee though."
157170,B0001IOSCM,A3RX6E9EP1J5WW,Christy B,5/5,5.0,1289952000,"I can't believe I'm reviewing this, but....","...it's just one of those awesome little things you have to share.<br /><br /> I was stationed in Hawaii for more than 8 of the last 24+ years at different times and one of the joys of Hawaii (among many) is the great local food. The downside is that finding the particulars that make local Hawaiian cuisine so fun and tasty are hard to locate in one place in most of the rest of the USA.<br /><br /> A common favorite is a dish called Ahi Poke. Though you can Poke lots of other fish, Ahi Poke is the most frequently enjoyed. Ahi is just tuna, though a slightly different type. The one used for this dish is a sushi grade raw Ahi. The part that is Poke is a blend of various spices, oils and a specific seaweed and it gives an absolutely unique and delightful flavor. It is a firm family favorite whether we simply scoop some over a dish of rice or make it into a sushi wrap. Most people who like any sushi at all love Ahi Poke.<br /><br /> Alas, thinking I should be able to find all the various spices and ingredients in any big city I didn't bring any with me from Hawaii. Getting all of those ingredients in one spot proved impossible. Even just consistently locating all of them anywhere was an exercise in hours of cross city driving and frustration.<br /><br /> So, on the off chance one day I typed in a search for the brand of pre-packaged Ahi Poke mix I used in Hawaii..Noh..and voila: Amazon had it! I bought a case just in time for my nephews birthday and he was absolutely gobsmacked to have a nice big bowl of his favorite food.<br /><br />  This package makes THE Ahi Poke. You can find recipes using more common seaweeds or other substitutions all over the net, but this is the real deal. That same rich and exotic flavor blend you remember from that shabby shop on the North Shore is right in this package. Each individual package is labeled to work for 1 pound of fish but I found that using 3/4 of a pound gives about the correct flavor. A pound makes it a tad weak. Of course, that's a lot of fish anyway. We tend to think in terms of hamburger or steak but the richness of raw Ahi means people will generally eat significantly less in ounces than they would other meats.<br /><br />  Love this stuff and I certainly recommend it. The price may seem high for a packet of spice, but the bulk prices on that seaweed, when you can even get it, is pretty high so this is actually quite reasonable. Happy Sushi!"

Which is not to suggest that using this scalp treatment by Clear Scalp made me look or feel like a greaser or anything. In fact, the oil in this product feels pretty much like any other oil when I put it on my fingers, but when I rubbed it into my scalp, it dissipated quite aggressively. I even had to add a few drops more to cover my entire head after the first application got soaked into my skin and hair so easily. Clear Scalp didn't make my hair sticky and it didn't give it a very ""wet"" look. It just looks like I might have put some mousse or gel there and tousled my hair a bit. In other words, it seems greasy, but isn't. I have to say, too, that I'd actually been having a bit of dry scalp itchiness when I finally got around to trying this product, and it seems to have helped a lot. The itchiness has been reduced, I like the look of my hair, and this treatment is easy to use and reliably consistent. I was almost sure that any kind of hair or scalp oil would only rate two or three stars at the most, as this is 2012 and oily hair is for Lenny and Squiggy and Elvis impersonators, but this is a solid product. I'm confident in giving it a full five star rating, deservingly so."

They're not common cookie cutter cookies. Somehow they almost seem friendly.<br /><br />Another notable thing is the slick resealable packaging. It had to be designed by a genius. When you pull the top of the package where it says ""lift,"" it slides back almost zipper-like to reveal the cookies and allows enough finger room to extract 4-5 of them at a time. (This is good if you're hungry, in hurry or sneaking cookies.) The top then glides back in place and seals the cookies completely so no air can get in. An engineering marvel!<br /><br />You may ask why the world needs another chocolate cookie. I don't know. I do know that people who eat chocolate cookies are known to be nice people. The world needs more of them. The world would be a friendlier place if more people had chocolate cookie crumbs clinging to their chins.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor in these cookies is more subtle than overpowering and isn't sickeningly sweet. Two or three cookies can satisfy a moderate chocolate craving, and four to six, a serious addiction. And you don't need teeth.

Yeah, it's supposed to look somewhat broad and dark, but I'm working on that.  It is truly a tasty, dense, dark, moist, chewy bread that goes well with cream cheese and lox; it's great toasted with butter.  I learned to sour some rye flour for about 24-36 hours with water and a little yeast and create the dough from there--helps to create a good rye that bakes well.  I don't use caraway, but this last time I added a tablespoon or so of dried onion flakes to the dough as I mixed it.  That was tasty.  It's hard to find dark rye flours and pumpernickel meal in Texas, and finding the flour really helped a lot in my escape from white flours.  I used to call this ""linoleum bread"" when I bought it for my husband.  No more name-calling, no more buying.  If you work without a recipe, remember that the dough will be sticky to knead; I usually use half again the amount of yeast I'd use in a white loaf.

For this one, I used 2 bags for 24 oz hot water.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas, each bag is sealed in its own foil pouch to protect its delicate flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients, in order listed, are: hibiscus, rosehips, lemongrass, yumberry flavor, chicory root, blackcurrant flavor, blackcurrant powder, and licorice powder.  Contains soy.  It is a 100 % natural, herbal, caffeine free product."

I find that taking the time to savor the fragrance of the Magnolia Puerh is  ""centering.""  This is a mild tea, that leaves a nice aftertaste.  I've been trying to chose green teas over black, but haven't found any green teas that I like as well as this one.  To be honest, while I definitely enjoyed this variety, my favorite remains the Numi Ginger Oolong.<br /><br />Even reading the box and recognizing the care that is taken with this product (and all the certifications that it has)  confirms it's not my imagination that drinking Numi is not the equivalent of having other teas...even the organic ones.  After having this green tea blend, it's going to be hard to use those other brands in my cupboard."

And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too.

Before the bars arrived at my doorstep, I was expecting a typical fruit-n-nut type of food bar that contains whole pieces of chunky nuts. So I was a little disappointed when I opened one and saw that the nuts were broken into tiny pieces instead. The bar was also shorter than I'd imagined.<br /><br />But the good thing is, the taste didn't disappoint. All the bars were not dry and hard, but instead they were moist and firm even when they were kept in the refrigerator. It would be a different texture if huge chunky nuts are used. Those who found them hard and dry probably got bars that were too close to their sell-by date. My bars had a good 10 months to go before expiring.<br /><br />What I like most is the fact that Jocalat Organic Chocolate Coffee (and later I found out it applies to other flavors of Larabar as well) these bars were not sickening sweet like other energy bars I've tasted. It's quite sad to taste a food bar prepared with good ingredients being drenched in excessive sweeteners, no matter how healthy the sweetener is touted to be. But this bar did not gross me out like other bars did, and in fact, satisfied my sweet tooth pretty well.<br /><br />Since I am a chocolate lover, especially dark ones, the smell and taste of the cocoa in the bar added to my satisfaction rating. There was also a subtle hint of coffee, but it was almost undetectable if you're not mindful enough.<br /><br />I wish the bars are bigger though. I'm in no way a large man, but I find one bar hardly makes me feel full, though it does stop my hunger pang.<br /><br />After trying this product, I've since moved on to other flavors. I found that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EO0XAE"">Larabar Fruit & Nut Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut Chew, 1.8-Ounce Bars, 16-Count</a> has almost the same taste as this. The coconut shreds in it have no taste but gives a distinctive coconut texture. But since this bar isn't made of organic ingredients, the price is lower than the Jocalat series. If budget is a concern to you, then you may want to consider that bar instead.<br /><br />One tip: As with any food bars, always eat Larabar with a full glass of water. Although not as hard and dry like other bars, it can get a bit dry on the throat when you're near the end."

I took a sip of the coffee before putting anything in it and I was shocked that I actually liked the taste of this. Normally coffee is so bitter and strong tasting to me, but this had a sweet floral-tinged taste to it.

I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils."

Second time they looked just like a stiff store-bought cookie and were crispy on the edges while gooey in the middle. The dough also looked different the each time - dry but combined well the first, and almost sticky the second. It seems there may be some kind of consistency issue but so far that has no hurt the quality or taste at all and we've been very pleased with this mix.<br /><br />Note: We made the cookies each time with Ener-G egg replacer.<br /><br />And yes, the dough smells awful but that hasn't hurt the taste of the cookies in the end!"

I'm always looking to mix up my selection because that is one of the true benefits of the Keurig machines. I read the reviews trying to determine how dark/strong Fog Chaser was and could not quite nail down the strength. I relied on the name and thankfully knew about the packaging. I keep mine in a canister after realizing I had an extra one to spare, which will keep the air out. I quite liked the k-cup design, it looks like it creates less waste.<br /><br />Fog Chaser clearly says on the side that it is a darker brown but does not show that it is the strongest. I will have to investigate which is stronger. This k-cup did give me a nice smooth strong 12 oz cup of coffee. It had no weird after taste and it wasn't bitter. I forgive bitter strong coffees because that is a product, often enough, of stronger coffees that could be manufactured better. I'm no snob but I also don't drink watered down coffee (i.e. Starbuck's new Blonde coffee).<br /><br />I will definitely order this again. I've never had coffee from this company before but I think I'm quite the fan. I also ordered the 3 12 packs because they shipped sooner and the idea that they would stay fresher longer was appealing. The price was slightly higher though, of course. Now that I have a canister that fits 36, I will go ahead and buy the other packaging and likely subscribe."

There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices. They would be a much better choice than this Marley.

If I'm really trying to save money that week, I just have a can a day. Half a can with rice, for lunch, and half a can with rice for dinner. I prefer to have it with long grain rice since its generally a bit dryer and goes better with the liquidy nature of the chili. I eat it with cheetos flaming hot chips, not the healthiest diet by any means, but it is a VERY cheap meal, and tastes great with the combination of things.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Hoffman ""artist and musician""",1/1,4.0,1329868800,More like a Chocolate Cherry Cookie Bar,"These Eat/Think/Smile baked nutrition bars, are more like a cookie, than a protein bar. Why? Because they have the same nutritional value of a cookie. Each cookie has 200 calories, with 7 grams of FAT, 34 grams of carbs, and 4 grams of Protein. There's a bit of a problem with the saltiness too, with 240mg of Salt. So, if you need a meal replacement, this isnt it. It simply doesnt have enough protein. On the plus side, these taste really good. They're sweetened with brown sugar, and dextrose and brown rice syrup. As for the chocolate, they are using some South American chocolate, so if you have issue with the child slaves working in the Ivory Coast chocolate farms, your conscious will be relieved. The taste overall is rich, chewy, and complex, mixing the chocolate, cherry and walnut flavors, in a whole wheat-corn-oat flour. Also, the bars have a lot of naturally occuring minerals and vitamins, including magnesium 10% and Iron 6%. Still, if I were thinking of buying a nutrician bar, I'd recommend a protein bar, that's vitamin fortafied.  If you are supplimenting a meal, or need a lunch box snack, etc, then these nutrition bars arent a bad choice."

I really liked that this brand is independently certified as organic and along with the standard added viatmins that all infant cereals have, it also has both PREBIOTICS AND PROBOIOTICS, which are proven to assist in better digestion and overall GI health. I mixed her serving with breastmilk and the consistancy is soft and fluffy. It doesn't have a weird grey color that other brands have, nor does it have a weird aftertaste either (I always taste whatever I feed my dauther first). This infant oatmeal cereal tastes and smells like real oatmeal, minus the added sugars. While it costs more than the standard brands, I feel it's well worth the money for the high quality and taste your child will get.<br /><br />My daughter took to this oatmeal right away and it really made feeding her a breeze. She is now 7 months old and she still eats this for breakfast regularly, along with some fresh fruits. While I mainly feed her homemade food, I have no qualms about feeding her this brand of oatmeal and neither should you. She has never had an allergic reaction nor has she had any digestive problems afterwards, which I feel is due to the added PRE/PROBIOTICS. So, if you are looking for a healthy, organic oatmeal cereal option for your baby, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing the Plum Organics brand. It's a great way to start your child on the right path to eating healthy and tasty first foods!<br /><br />*Amazon has the BEST prices for bulk purchasing this item!*"

If something like this happens anytime soon, I'll be sure to amend my review with a cautionary blurp.<br /><br />One minor issue with the bottle itself is the cap.  It isn't the easiest to open when you're wet or cramped in the shower.  It doesn't have an easily `poppable' cap.

I like all four flavors although the Smokey/Chili could be spicier and have more lime flavor for my taste. The cinnamon is my least favorite but it is still a tasty treat. I really like mixing the pepper and sea salt together. The only downside in my view of the Good Bean is the sodium content. 7% daily sodium is higher than I'd like (each packet is 2 servings so one packet has a lot of sodium (over 300 mg).

From the first bite I'm pretty sure I got a hilarious look of astonishment on my face. It's like nothing I ever tasted before--weird, but quite good, which is about how I felt when I first bit into a properly ripe mango. Definitely the spices are unique when balanced with the sweet potato flavor. I think I tasted some garlic, but I know there's a very faint smidgeon of cayenne, and the cilantro was noticeable as well, but no one flavor or spice overwhelms the others, which is good.<br /><br />If you like any sort of spiced potato chips, like mesquite barbecue or jalapeno or the buffalo ranch doritos, I'd give these babies a try. They're healthy and you might find a nice occasional alternative to the not-so-healthy stuff. Hey, if it tastes good, why not? One thing these chips prove is that not all ""health food"" has to taste bland or nasty. Sort of like spelt bread and Newman's ginger cookies, and Izze's luscious pear soda. Terra's spiced sweet potato chips have a surprising flavor and are probably not for everyone, but if you like the spicy kind of regular chips, pick up a bag of these somewhere--they'll probably be just your sort of thing."

It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale ""town mouse"" to my regular, boring ""country mouse"" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love."

I love key lime pie to begin with, so I was beyond excited to find a bar in that flavor.<br /><br />While it didn't taste exactly like a Key Lime Pie, this bar did have a lot of lime flavor.  It also had some crunchy nuts that contrasted nicely with the almost fruit chews texture of the rest of the bar.  I also was able to taste the hint of coconut in there as well.  Between those three flavors, it tasted very fresh and almost like I was eating a fruit salad in bar form.  Definitely a pleasant experience.<br /><br />The ingredient list on this bar is phenomenal.  Only 5 ingredients are in it:  dates, cashews, almonds, coconut, and lime juice.  That's it, no hard to pronounce ingredients, no added sweeteners, just plain food that is easily recognized by just about anyone.  In fact, according to the package, because of those ingredients, this bar equals 1/4 of a cup of fruit.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, this bar is about on par with most other fitness bars.  It has 220 calories, which is high for a snack but good for if you're working out or as a meal replacement.  Sugars are high, 24 grams, but at least it's from all natural foods and not because they dumped a pile of sugar in the bar.  There's also some vitamins hiding in there, but those too aren't from vitamins injected into the food.<br /><br />A pretty good bar.  I'm eager to try out the other Larabars and see if they're just as good.  And I know I'll definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of six this comes at a good value. The fact that this cereal is low-fat makes a good product even better if you are trying to lose some weight or wanting to keep in shape.<br /><br />Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 6-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.<br /><br />Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape game<br /><br />My own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.<br /><br />Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:<br /><br />- ""Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss"" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.<br /><br />- ""The ABS Diet"", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.<br /><br />- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).<br /><br />- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).<br /><br />- ""Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot"", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.<br /><br />If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.<br /><br />I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.<br /><br />Get this 6-pack of Low-fat Muesli to help your 6-pack ABS."

Her little hands and face got dirty and it was good to see her enjoying the whole process.  But when the mixing was done, the comment from her mouth was ""That's all?""  For all the work that got put in it made 4 cookies.  The cookies were good but my little girl was somewhat disappointed by the quantity that she was able to make.  Oh well, we can call it ""enforced portion control"" right?"
515929,B001EQ5IU6,A2JF46VL3ALR5B,GC,12/16,3.0,1287964800,Unfortunately too good to be true...,"I bought Chocagave based on the rave reviews and ""healthy"" claims (based on being organic, raw, and using ""natural"" sweetener). It really is very tasty as a chocolate syrup and excellent for making hot chocolate. It's fairly liquid, so drizzles well on top on dessert, while not being watery (for example, I think Hershey's syrup seems runny as well as tasting yucky).<br /><br />The unfortunate part comes in the ""natural"" raw agave syrup used in this chocolate. Yes, I'm sure it's organic and raw like the maker claims BUT I've recently started reading about how UNNATURAL agave nectar really is. Agave is apparently a created sweetener concocted sometime in the 1990s by manufacturers using the same process as high fructose corn syrup, except with the starchy part of the agave plant rather than corn. As a result, agave nectar is made up of same unhealthy fructose (a higher percentage than high fructose corn syrup) that experts claim increases obesity, insulin resistance, etc, etc. (You've probably heard the arguments if you're looking for more natural sweeteners because you do believe high fructose corn syrup is bad).<br /><br />So, fructose might be a low glycemic sweetener, but I'm disappointed that the healthier alternative chocolate syrup that I bought isn't as healthy as I thought it would be. Sure, it's chocolate dessert and should be used in moderation but I was not aware that agave syrup being a ""natural"" alternative is mostly hype.<br /><br />Know what you're buying and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH on whether this is a good choice for you. It might be great for a diabetic without any other good options (since I think fake sweeteners taste funny and are probably even unhealthier). For me, I don't think it's really worth the additional expense to buy something I know isn't necessarily any healthier than organic chocolate with real sugar."

I didn't know what brand would taste the most like what was bought from this coffee/tea stand.  I liked that Stash has a decaf, because I intended to have it as an evening drink so I went with that.<br /><br />Day one, I didn't steep it long, yet it tasted very strong.  I added skim milk as that is what I use, which did not help it along since it's not rich, also I added sugar as it's supposed to be a sweet drink.<br /><br />Day 2, I bought regular soy milk, no low fat or no vanilla soy since the tea has vanilla.  I didn't steep the tea as long, I used a bit more water, then added 1/4 of a cup of soy milk along with 2 good sized teaspoons of sugar.  It tasted perfect! I think I could probably reuse the tea bag today for my 3rd cup!<br /><br />Reviews can be off when people do not use a product properly, and maybe other users are used to a different brand, as I have seen other brands with different ingredients.  I'm happy with it, to where I don't feel the need anymore to try another tea, since at first, I thought I may have to.

I do not give her Greenies daily, but I have noticed that every time I do give her one in the morning, her bowel movements are not formed well and very loose during her afternoon walk. This could well be a reaction in just my dog and not for others, but I would rather err on the side of caution. These just don't seem to digest well for my pup, so I will not be buying another bag.

My dog is a Cockapoo and although he is generally not a picky eater, he likes some treats more than others.  (So far the Science Diet treats and Milkbones have not been winners.)<br /><br />My first impression was that I really liked the ingredients list.  Unlike a lot of dog treats, I actually understood and recognized all the ingredients and the fact that the ingredients were all organic were a plus.  Of course, I knew none of this would make a difference if my dog didn't like them.<br /><br />So what was the result?  Most of the time he really likes these treats, though he still prefers more of the jerky-style and chewy treats.  (I know this because there have been a few occasions when he has turned these treats down for whatever reason but will still gladly accept one of the others.)  Most of the time though he seems very happy to have one of these.<br /><br />Worth noting, these treats seem a little large for my 20-lb sized dog.  They can easily be broken in half, but breaking them in half again from there can be tricky.  Unlike some other large-sized treats he doesn't have a difficult time eating these, but boy are they crumbly.  Because he has to take several bites to eat one crumbs usually go everywhere.  He's a thorough eater so generally I haven't had a problem with a mess being left behind BUT I don't know that I would want him eating these treats on carpet or another surface where crumbs could get trapped.<br /><br />Overall, they are a good treat.  I appreciate the ingredient list and the fact my dog likes them, but wish they were a little smaller so he could eat them without them crumbling everywhere."

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings.

Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

414995,B005VOOLXM,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""",0/0,3.0,1332979200,Not bad,"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product."

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself.

I have since become a little more lenient in my diet but this is an old favorite. I do the beginning as suggested, boil 2.5c water and then add the chili mix (1 box) but from there, I do my own thing. They suggest using 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of beans but I find that I get a much more mellow but still hearty, flavorful chili and it either feeds several more or leaves a good bit leftover by adding the following: 1 can of Great Northern beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of diced tomatoes, and a bit of powdered garlic (I picked the different beans for flavor/color/texture variation and the garlic is based on your personal tastes). If it's too thick for you, add up to 1 can of stewed tomatoes so that it thins it without diluting the flavor.<br /><br />Anyways, it tastes great fresh out of the pot with cheese and sour cream or on top of a baked potato. Unless I am serving others, my son and I always have leftovers but they freeze well if we don't want to eat them in the next couple of days. The real taste test was serving this to both my grandfather and my dad...they are big meat eaters who would have refused to eat it if I had told them up front it was vegetarian.

The packaging was a little tricky using it for the first time, but the second time was a piece of cake.  I had some difficulty with the tamper proof wrap around the package as it is very tight and there isn't anywhere to grab it.  But using a fork solved that problem.  The directions were simple and straight forward, although I think something should have been said about removing the top covering material from the built in strainer before microwaving.  I will give credit that there is a pull tab that states this on the top of the container, however, since it's not in the directions, someone might not do this the first time.  The packaging is beautifully done with a convenient pull tab to take out the sauce bin and the built in strainer is nearly perfect (maybe add a couple of holes in the lip to aid draining, as water will collect there).<br /><br />Add water to the fill line, place into microwave, and out comes perfect pasta - not too soft and not too hard.  Then put the sauce into the microwave - this you need to be careful with.  The sauce will splatter a little in the microwave and the time (30 seconds) was not enough for me; I needed another 20 seconds.  Take it out and take off the plastic cover - a little tricky as you can splash yourself with the hot sauce in this step.<br /><br />The amount of sauce is perfect.  The taste is a little spicy (hot), and some might think it's too spicy, but I thought it was quite good.  There is enough meat in the sauce to let you know that it is a meat sauce.  I tasted it with and without added cheese and liked it both ways.  The volume of food is perfect for lunch.  There are 340 calories in the serving with only 6 grams of fat (2 saturated), and 8 grams of fiber.

It's unbelievably buttery, rich, and smooth, with specks of real vanilla throughout.<br /><br />Here's my favorite way to use G&B: heat up a cup and a half of whole milk to scalding hot (microwaving it works fine). Break up one bar of G&B white chocolate into small pieces. Whisk the pieces into the milk until smooth, then pour into two small mugs or glasses and serve.

I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.

The first one was perfect, and allowed me to discover the superb quality of the tea from the Diyagama West Estate.  While taste is very much a personal matter, this is my favorite Ceylon, and I have sampled more than a dozen high end Ceylon teas.  Therefore, even though the tea was relatively expensive, I was sold.  Soon thereafter I placed a second order.  This time I did not receive Diyagama West, rather a virtually identical looking package, but that clearly identified that its content was from the Kirkoswald estate.  Also a nice tea, but distinctly different, and, to my taste, nowhere near as sophisticated as the Diyagama West.  Since I opened the package, I used both of them up, and placed my third order. Received Kirkoswald again. This time I called Amazon and tried to correct the problem.  Amazon was great, as always. They promised to send a replacement of the correct product. The replacement I received was Kirkoswald AGAIN. Then I waited three months or so, and decided to try again.  Kirkoswald showed up once more.  I believe that whatever inventory location is supposed to hold the Diyagama has been stocked with Kirkoswald, and since the packaging looks so very similar, except for the estate name on the label, this way well remain uncorrected until the current stock runs out, and the bin location is replenished with the correct, Diyagama Estate product.<br /><br />When placing an order with Amazon, sophisticated, quick, and easy as it is, there is no way to add a comment or alert to CHECK the box and to NOT send Kirkoswald.  The only was to correct a mixup is through customer service after the product has been delivered. So on my fourth order, that is what I did, and Amazon, once again, corrected the financial aspect, but I am still without the tea I enjoy the most."

465410,B0002SPRN0,A3F9DLB6ZLL13B,Dan Robinson,15/16,1.0,1156636800,Some Education About Vegan Cats,"Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians.<br /><br />Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know ""garbage in, garbage out!""<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix."

I'm not a fan of air-popped corn.  It takes the character out of the corn.<br /><br />Microwave popcorn, in my experience, has always been a bit on the chewy side, sometimes too salty, and occasionally tasting processed.<br /><br />THEN I discovered the Black Jewell microwave popcorn.  While you have to be careful not to cook too long (it cooks pretty quickly), this popcorn comes out crunchy, not too oily, natural tasting and with just the right amount of salt.  It comes pretty darn close to stove top popped.  The hulls are very small here, so by the time they kernels are popped, what's left is mostly the white, but there is the tiny black center.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving this popcorn a try.

(Not having a food motivated dog SUCKS for training - I could literally be walking around with big macs in my pockets and it just wouldn't matter) They are low calorie and reasonably cheap (I can actually find them at some local stores cheaper than I can on Amazon, sometimes) as the bags tend to last a while. (I actually use kibble mixed with the treats when working with her, becuase I'm sneaky like that and she doesn't notice the difference once we get going)<br /><br />Of course not all dogs work with all treats - and it SHOULD be noted that although these treats do not have a lot of the ""bad"" ingredients in them they still do have grains. (NO grain treats have a much different texture, either from being pure meat or using various ingredients as the ""binder"" necessary for treats like this)<br /><br />This is the only type of treat we feed that has grains in it; almost everything else she eats is pure meat in various fashions. (lamb lung, water buffalo, venison, rabbit, etc)<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies you may want to try some of the grain-free options for training treats, like the mini lamb lungs or mini beef jerkies, etc. For our needs, though, these are perfect. \<br /><br />I was SO psyched when I saw that they came out with the ""rabbit"" variety! I try to keep the variety going in her diet and she doesn't like the peanut butter kind so it was always down to alternating between chicken or salmon, both of which are very common proteins. I can't tell if she likes this kind more or not, but she's definitely eating them which is a good sign! They tend to be more expensive than the other variety so I don't buy them as often, but love including it in the mix!<br /><br />One last thing I wanted to mention, my Mom has small dogs (tiny chihuahuas) and they can eat this size training treat with ease. However, I recently purchased the SMALL training treats for her (they are usually about 1/2 cal per treat) and she said that they are PERFECT for her sized dogs that she is constantly trying to diet. I don't believe they are made in that size by Zuke's but there are several brands out there that also use similar ingredients (no bad preservatives, no corn, by products, etc) that may work better for very small dogs."

However, I've been on a few long  driving trips with my wife and I felt myself getting drowsy. I noted such to my wife so as to warn her. She asked if I'd like a stick of gum. She said it helped you to keep alert. Hmmmm. I'd never heard of that. Well, I tried it and chewing gum worked remarkably well for that task. It makes good sense. Have you ever tried to chew gum and fall asleep at the same time? It just won't work.<br /><br />Well, the other day I was in our nearby grocery store and I spotted some Trident Vitality gum of a variety called Awaken. That sounded like just the thing to have in the glove compartment of the car. It's a real fresh, zesty, peppermint-flavored gum with added ginseng. Tastes real good. Plus, it's sugar free. It comes in little ""pillows"" rather than sticks and I'd probably have to chew a couple to get a good effect. It's somewhat expensive for chewing gum, but if it helps to keep me awake on the road, it's well worth it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

They put about 85% FILLER in the bags (dextrose for one, which is sugar!). They do that so a cup of splenda will equal out to a cup of sugar, like BIG DEAL! I want to buy sucralose, not FILLER! Anyhow, I love powdered Drink mix, been using KOOL AID and Whylers UN-Sweetened where instead of adding sugar, I added Splenda. This 2.0 fl oz bottle came in from Amazon and I wanted to give it a try. It says on the bottle that 1 Teaspoon = 2 Cups of Sugar. I always make a Gallon of KoolAid, so that 2 cups equal is perfect! I made it as normal, put in the fridge, oh and I left one full glass of the Splenda version that was from the last pitcher I made. 3 Hours later I try the drink and it's not sweet at all. Very under sweetened. So I added 1 more teasoon to the gallon pitcher, tasted about the same as the splenda brand now. So it's really 2 Teasoons = 2 cups of sugar (or 1 teaspoon = 1 cup of sugar). It says this is = to a 10 LB Bag of sugar on the box the bottle comes in, so it's really half of that. Still, you get 11 cups worth of sugar from this bottle (going by the 5 LB Bag usage), it's still alot cheaper to buy this than the big bag of splenda, the price is about the same, give or take a few dollars for the spenda 9 oz bag, that you only get about 6 cups of sugar tops.<br />  I would deff buy this again and will when I run out. Just wish they made this into a larger bottle, I mean like a bottle of Ketchup size, sure it would cost $50, but I'd buy it. This won't last me a real long time and I have never seen this pure Sucralose in stores.<br />  I have also been using Stevia of lates, NOW Foods on Amazon sells a huge 1 LB jar of it for $45.

It's a very good buy for the money, but let's be clear that it is not a ""Good"" olive oil.  True, it is extra virgin and cold pressed, but remember that any oil from large brands like Colavita, Bertolli, etc.. is filtered and mixed which means that it is not the way nature intended it.  My recommendation is that this is a great oil for cooking, and frying;fry an egg in Olive oil and you will never eat eggs another way again.  But if you want to make a simple greek salad for example, where olive and salt is the only dressing, you should go for the premium stuff that you'll find at your local gourmet food shop or in a meditteranean market.  My personal favorite (and yes I am biased because of my background) is Greek Olive oil from Messinia (southern peloponesus), but there are some varieties from Crete that are excellent as well.  Try to find one that is from a single source (meaning that it is not mixed with different varieties of olive oils to make a consistent taste), it's okay if your olive oil is different from one batch to the other, because that is natural."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

I was worried that I wouldn't be able to sleep that night (I took this at around 9 am) but it finally did wear off after I ate lunch. I'm only going to take this once or twice a week on days that I want to do a long, intense workout session and have the time to devote to a workout like that. I'm worried that I might develop a tolerance to it if I take it more often, so just a couple times a week for me. But this stuff works better than any other ""energy"" supplement I've tried.

There are a lot of times where she will tire of biscuits and seem reluctant to take them, but that was not the case with these things.  When she heard either one of us messing with the packaging, she would be right there to make her presence known and show us her ""puppy dog"" eyes.  As you bend down to hand one to her, she would jump up on her hind legs and excitedly grab it from you and run off to consume it.<br /><br />Teeth cleaning ability? We were only able to sample 1 bag up front, so I can not comment on how well they would do over time, but can say that they did appear to be soft and chewy and looked like they would clean teeth over a period of weeks.  As for her breath?  Again, not enough quantity to make a call one way or another, but she did not have what I would consider bad breath.<br /><br />On a practical level, these things seem to be a bit pricey (as healthy foods tend to be) at about a dollar per...  If you believe that your pet could benefit from these for a short period of time, then go ahead and try them.  However, if your pet already seems to be in good shape, stick with what you are doing and don't over do it.<br /><br />This will not cost the product any stars, as all necessary information is provided for you to review before your purchase and the fact that our Yorkie likes them.

So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth."

He was a rescue at an emergency animal clinic I worked for at that time. Because of my experience working with animals and learning about good nutrition for dogs and how to read a dog food label he has generally been an Iams guy. But when I had my baby and got Amazon Mom and then Amazon Prime I thought I'd take a look at the Subscribe and Save options to see if there were any high quality foods I could get a good deal on. There are several and this had other good reviews so we tried it. It is a good food with actual meat as its primary protein source and some possibly helpful (but not at all harmful) additions like the flax seed etc. It seemed to taste okay to Wizard, the main problem was that he is a little old dog with a little old mouth. The pieces are frankly too big for him and at his age even with regular cleanings his teeth are worn down and a few are gone. So he would swallow it whole it appears and then sometimes that would cause him to toss it back up shortly thereafter.<br />Now I have him on Iams Senior Plus (for dogs older than 11) I don't know if that is helping, but it is much smaller pieces for his small old mouth.<br />I have nothing bad to say about this product though. If I had a younger, larger dog I would still be ordering it. It is a great value for the quality of the ingredients."

I coughed a bit and was fine, but it was something that could've been avoided.<br /><br />I highly recommend these little seeds as a dietary supplement for the omega-3's and 6's.

I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting.

Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of ""chip-lets"" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste.

There were no instructions on how to prepare the brew. I did not worry. I expected the shipped coffee to contain enough instructions on arrival. It did not.<br /><br />If, however, I had gone to the non-VINE website of Amazon I would have received a clue how to brew the coffee: ""Directions<br />For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers.""<br /><br />I don't own a ""single server home coffee pod brewer,"" so the test was going to prove difficult at best, although I did not think so at the time.<br /><br />Then came in the mail an attractively packaged, colorful cardboard box, full of small print texts extolling various aspects of the product with Lion of Judah logo, photo of a Rastafarian man and a statement from musician Bob Marley about how he had founded his organic coffee and tea company as a tribute to his father who had come from Nine Mile, Jamaica.<br /><br />Very instructive. But no brewing instructions anywhere. I scissored open the air-sealed plastic cover for one of the 15 small pods enclosed of ground coffee. No instructions.<br /><br />Here are the various ways I went about making Marley coffee:<br /><br />(1) Were these 15 like similar pods I had seen in motels with DIY coffee makers?Where you toss pods in a plastic  filter and add hot water into the back of the machine. Then throw a switch. Expect two cups of coffee to emerge. So I scissored open four plastic bags, detecting in the process a beyond faint aroma that I had years earlier come to associate with kidneys for breakfast in bed and breakfasts in Ireland. I tossed four pods into my Mr. Coffee Machine<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041847R4"">Mr. Coffee CG12 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, White</a> and added enough water in my to make eight cups of coffee. No paper filter. Result: tasty, several ingredients detected. Very weak!<br /><br />(2) After discussion with my wife, I next decided to make a mere two cups of coffee using only two pods in Mr. Coffee, this time placing a paper filter beneath the pods. Same initial urine smell. Same good taste. Stronger.<br /><br />(3) Still my wife and I, in the absence of written instructions, decided there must be a simpler, cleaner way. We next treated a pod as if it were a single serving tea bag -- minus a string. We therefore put one pod in a coffee mug and poured boiling water over it. Same Irish kidneys smell. Decent taste when done. Rather a mess, however, fishing out the pod with a spoon.<br /><br />Bottom line: even when weak, Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count offered a strikingly better than average taste. I would drink it again if only I had the right equipment.<br /><br />-OOO-"

I enjoy seeing how different flavors play off the matcha base! I think this is one of the more complex matcha I have tried. Its not exactly what you might think it would be with the nutty flavor coming out at the end but it is most definitively plum in the beginning. I like how the nutty sneaks up on me!"

I have tried many sweeteners over the years, some of which caused me some severe reactions.  Years ago, I decided I preferred stevia.  Lately I did another comparison between the different stevia brands.  Better Stevia Organic in the packets is the one I decided to go with.  I do not bake with sweeteners and eat very little baked goods since I am selective on how I expend my carb allowance.  Mostly I just use the stevia in beverages. The organic stevia packets are lined with an inner seal, I suppose to keep it fresh and to keep it from getting hard. However when you hold the packet over a cup of hot beverage the stevia draws moisture and clings to the liner making it difficult to pour out. I simply add the stevia to my cup before I pour in the liquid.  It also does not dissolve quickly in iced beverages.  It takes a minute or two for it to completely dissolve. I like this Stevia Organic enough to deal with these issues.  It does not have additional ingredients.  It is just organic stevia and I like it that way."

""Satan's Blood"" measures 800,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU)! The means it's up to 320 times hotter!! It's best used as a food additive. I like how I can put just a drop or two in a bowl of chili and it makes it hot but does not change the overall taste like weaker vinegar based sauces will.<br /><br />As a hot pepper enthusiast, I rate this product as VERY HOT...but not extremely hot. Remember though, like beauty, hotness is in the eye of the beholder. Most people WOULD rate this as EXTREMELY HOT...but I've been a fan of hot foods for decades.

I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas.

So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars.

I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."

My son has been on Earth's Best formula since he was one week old and has no problems at all.<br /><br />Here is what I LIKE about Earth's Best:<br /><br />ORGANIC.  I am very conscious about what I put in my own body so I wouldn't not have it any other way for my son. The use of pesticides and genetically modified ingredients is a terrifying concept to me. EB contains no growth hormones, antibiotics, steroids or potentially harmful pesticides or herbicides.<br /><br />EASY TO DIGEST. My son has no fussiness or issues with this formula. He's happy and content and has had no issues with gas or spitting up due to the formula. My son was a very colicky baby but we had tested out a few formulas before concluding that it was definitely not the EB causing his fussiness.<br /><br />AFFORDBILITY. Due to the recent recall of Similac organic formula, Earth's Best became the only affordable organic formula on the market that I could find readably available. The only other option available on the market besides Earth's Best is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJM9SU"">Babys Only Organic Toddler Formula, Dairy Iron Fortified, 12.7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)</a> and at nearly $30 for 3 cans of 12.7 oz of formula was out of our means. With Amazon subscribe and save, this formula is nearly the same price as non-organic formula. How could I even consider feeding my son anything else?<br /><br />These are the ISSUES I have with the formula:<br /><br />SYRUP SOLIDS. Sugar in formula? Excuse me! This is really disappointing but I believe the organic element of the formula far outweighs switching to a non-organic formula. As I said earlier, Baby Only is too expensive to even be an option for us. Plus, I believe the use of pesticides in formula ingredients is a far more dangerous concept than sugar!<br /><br />DHA/ARA. I am not a fan of the synthetically derived DHA/ARA found in EB formula. However, there are no affordable formulas on the market that have naturally derived DHA/ARA. Therefore, its hard to judge EB alone. The formula industry should be required to find a NATURAL way to derive DHA/ARA if it should be allowed to market their product as organic.<br /><br />CLUMPS. The formula can be hard to mix properly without getting clumps. It takes an extra amount of patience and time to mix this formula. The best solution I have found is to mix the formula in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I481LM"">Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher</a>or use a handheld formula mixer such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K4Q9BG"">Prince Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer</a> when making one bottle at a time. This way I do not get the bubbles that form from vigorous shaking.<br /><br />Although the EB formula is not perfect, it is the most affordable organic formula made on the market. However, if it is within your means, you may want to do a little bit of research on Baby Only formula."

She does, however, LOVE to chew things that do not belong to her.  As you can imagine, this adds another level of stress to the already challenging work of raising a pup.  I heard about bully sticks and thought they would be a great choice for my dog.<br /><br />I found a package of this (Cadet) brand in a pack of (4) pieces of the 5"" size on clearance at my local grocery store.  So, please note that my review is for a slightly different item than the one shown here...I can only speak to the quality of the stick and not to the sizes or to the packaging or to the value per dollar for THIS package of bully sticks.<br /><br />That said, my puppy is in love with her first bully stick. She is gnawing on it as I type this, in fact!  Happy me!<br /><br />I do not smell the stick from here (about three feet away).  I put my nose INSIDE of the package, and smelled a mild meaty smell.<br /><br />I managed to get the partially gnawed stick from my pup and took a big whiff of a wet end, and I smelled a mild aroma similar to bacon.<br /><br />For what it is worth, I consider myself to be a person with an average to above average sense of smell, but then, the scent of smoky meat does not bother me one bit (we cook a lot of bacon).  I realize that I might not be the best judge.<br /><br />So, I asked my two daughters to smell it also.  They did not like the smell of the inside of the package, but each had to put her nose RIGHT INSIDE to smell anything.  Also, neither claims to be able to smell the stick while petting the dog, but if they stick their face right up by where she is chewing, they report it to smell like dog food.<br /><br />At the rate she is going, this stick could last her for a couple of days to a week.  I will be curious to see how it goes.<br /><br />My dog is a medium-sized breed, and is still a puppy.  The smaller pieces would probably not work out for her once she has grown up, but they are great for the size she is now (approx. 15 lbs.).<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful!"

The results were encouraging. Participants, drinking the cherry juice, showed significant reductions in known markers of inflammation and lower levels of triglycerides (blood fats) and LDL cholesterol -- both known risk factors for heart disease.<br /><br />Researcher, Dr. Mitch Seymour, who led an animal study at the University of Michigan, in which tart cherries were again found to lower inflammation, said: ""Chronic inflammation is a whole body condition that can affect overall health, especially when it comes to the heart. This study offers further promise that foods rich in antioxidants, such as cherries, could potentially reduce inflammation and have the potential to lower disease risk.""<br /><br />To start with, tart cherries can aid muscle recovery following exercise. A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine revealed that strength loss and pain following exercise were significantly less in the cherry juice trial compared to the placebo trial. Most notably, strength loss averaged over the four days after exercise was 22 per cent with the placebo but only 4 per cent with the cherry juice-drinkers.<br /><br />Several earlier studies have confirmed that tart cherries offer benefits for patients with autoimmune, neurodegenerative and connective tissue diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Studies show that tart cherries not only reduce pain and inflammation but also offer protection against cancer. These effects are attributed to the high amounts of plant phytochemicals, known as anthocyanins, they contain.<br /><br />Research has shown that a diet containing cherries is beneficial in reducing the risk of colon cancer. When researchers fed a diet containing tart cherries, anthocyanins, or cyanidin (a non-sugar breakdown product of anthocyanins) to mice with a genetic susceptibility to colon cancer, the animals developed significantly fewer and smaller colon tumours. This study also revealed that these compounds effectively reduced the growth of two human colon cancer cell lines.<br /><br />The cancer-protective benefits of this fruit were validated in another experimental study, in which cherry fruit extract reduced the growth of both human colon cancer cells and human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion.<br /><br />Researchers have suggested that a possible mechanism by which cherries may confer these benefits is through shutting down the growth of cancer cells by depriving them of the proteins they need to grow.<br /><br />Supporting melatonin levels and brain health<br /><br />Tart cherries are one of the few food sources of melatonin, a chemical released in the body by the pineal gland that is closely connected with the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin also acts as a powerful antioxidant, providing neuro-protective and immune-modulating effects.<br /><br />Ongoing scientific studies are demonstrating how foods naturally rich in melatonin - like Montmorency cherries - can help sufferers of insomnia gain deep, restful sleep.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also rich in phenolic compounds, which have strong neuro-protective activity. In a laboratory setting, cherry phenolics protected neuronal cells from cell-damaging oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Tart cherry compounds may therefore play an important role in protecting ageing adults against neurodegenerative conditions such as memory loss, senile dementia, and perhaps even Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Give it to me!<br /><br />Why do people use tart cherries and tart cherry juice?<br />Both sweet and tart cherries and cherry juice have long been used by traditional healers as a folk remedy for gout, because cherries are thought to lower urate levels in the body.<br /><br />Tart cherries are used for conditions involving inflammation and pain, such as:<br /><br />* arthritis<br />* gout<br />* muscle pain<br />* back pain<br />* diabetes<br />* neurodegenerative diseases<br /><br />Both sweet and tart cherries contain phenolics, naturally-occurring plant compounds that have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects.<br /><br />The main type of phenolic in cherries is called anthocyanins. In general, the darker the cherry color, the higher the anthocyanin content.<br /><br />Anthocyanins have been found to block two enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which play a role in the production of inflammatory compounds called prostaglandins. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen and ibuprofen also work this way.<br /><br />In test tube studies, cherry anthocyanins have been found to protect neurons from damage by oxidative stress. However, there have been no studies that have looked at whether cherry extracts could prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in humans.<br /><br />Both Balaton and Montmorency tart cherries contain relatively high levels of the antioxidant melatonin compared to other foods. Montmorency cherries contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do Balaton cherries.<br /><br />Are tart cherries more effective than sweet cherries?<br />Generally, tart cherries have been found to have higher concentrations of phenolics and anthocyanins than sweet cherries.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also slightly lower in sugar. Half a cup of sweet cherries contains 9.3 g of sugar and 46 calories, compared to 6.6 g of sugar and 39 calories in tart cherries.<br /><br />However, there is no real evidence that these differences are significant-both types of cherries are very high in anthocyanins compared with other foods.<br /><br />It may be that we are hearing more about the health benefits of tart cherries because of the way they are marketed. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to 29 cherry farmers and distributors for positioning tart cherries on their websites as a medicinal food that could possibly help people with gout, arthritis, diabetes, and prevent cancer.<br /><br />What research has been done on tart cherries?<br />Although anthocyanins, which are also found in blueberries and other purplish-red fruits and vegetables, are known to be powerful antioxidants, no studies have looked at whether cherries--tart or sweet--can relieve symptoms of arthritis, gout, or diabetes outside the lab.<br /><br />All studies involving cherries have been very small, so we'll have to wait to see whether tart cherries are beneficial and in what quantities. In the meantime, here are a few of the studies that have been conducted so far:<br /><br />* A small randomized controlled trial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine examined the effectiveness of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage. Fourteen male college students drank 12 fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo, twice per day for eight consecutive days. Strength loss was significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice (4%) compared with the placebo (22%). Pain was also significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice.<br /><br />* Jill M. Tall, Ph.D., research fellow at Johns Hopkins, was the lead researcher of a study that tested the effectiveness of orally administrated anthocyanins from tart cherries on inflammation-induced pain in rats. The results of the study suggested that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in reducing inflammatory pain.<br /><br />* One small study published in the Journal of Nutrition supported the anti-gout effectiveness of cherries. assessed the effects of Bing cherry (a sweet cherry) consumption on healthy women and found that cherry consumption decreased blood urate levels, and there was a marginal decrease in inflammatory markers c-reactive protein and nitric oxide."

The checkout station had a coffee grinder at the very end, so once Nonna paid for her groceries, she'd open the bag and dump the beans into the biiig grinder and flick the switch -- brrrrrrrrrrrrrp....!! the beans would grind, and oh what a wonderful smell!!!<br /><br />Every morning at breakfast, Nonna would set the glass percolator on our humble Bronx gas range, and brew herself a cup of 8 O'Clock Coffee. There she would sit at the kitchen table, listening to Italian operettas on Pasquale C.O.D.'s radio show, while dismembering a big chunk of Italian Bread (from Arthur Avenue), eating a soft boiled egg and regally quaffing her cuppa 8 O'Clock Coffee.<br /><br />The wonderful 8 O'Clock coffee, in its wonderful whole bean-ness, is still with us. Nonna, unfortunately is not. She left the world at the age of 94, and now listens to the angels (and most probably Pasquale C.O.D. himself) singing in Heaven.<br /><br />Nonna, this cup is in your memory!! * * Lifts cup, toasts Nonna Lucia, savors excellent brew flavor that brings back intense memories of a Bronx childhood and an Italian grandmother's love * *"

There is a specific texture to these that is hard to describe. When you first open the package, there is a fishy smell. The easiest way to deal with this is to dump the bag into a strainer over the sink (hold your nose if fishy smells bother you) and rinse with water for about 30 seconds. Then put the noodles in a bowl of water with vinegar in it (about 3 or 4 cups of water and 1 or 2 tablespoons of vinegar) and let it soak for about 10 minutes. This gets rid of the fishy smell. After I do this I like to split the package in half, put one half in a paper towel-lined container in the fridge, and ""saute"" the other half with a small amount of olive oil. This will replace the ""drying"" that is recommended. Then I add a sauce like spaghetti or curry sauce and eat.<br />I can't say that I really enjoy eating them all that much, BUT replacing my lunchtime meal with these noodles has helped me to lose about 3 pounds already. They really fill you up quickly, and the fiber is very good for you. I did a lot of research before I tried them, because I had heard a lot of bad things about the smell and texture, and after trying them I can say that the benefits outweigh all that. They're really not that bad if you prepare them as above. I would recommend them if you are trying to cut your calories."

A month ago, the local Petco informed me that Eukanuba was recalling some types of their dog dry food. It's a red flag in my mind! So I did more research and I fount out that Eukanuba is not worth how much I paid. To find the best food for my furry boys, I listed about 20 different products and kept narrowing down my list......<br /><br />THIS IS IT!!<br /><br />A website called DOG FOOD ANALYSIS gave this product a 6 star (the highest level of Dry Dog Food) and explained why they rated so. My boys easily jump into their new food on the first day~ I just wished that I can make this change earlier.<br /><br />The only drawback with TOTW High Prairie is: the FAT is relatively high, especially my boys are just family pets instead of working dog. I really need to pay attention on their weight control for health concern. The ideal protein for my small breed, adult dog is around 18% and recommended Fat is 9-15%. Because TOTW High Prairie has a minimum fat of 18% (refer to dogfoodanalysis.com), I usually mix it with Wellness Core Reduced Fat (Fat: 9-10%) to prevent overweight. They even love Wellness Core Reduced Fat more... I wish Wellness can have sale to make the price more affordable though.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if your dog is family pet like mine and has regular exerice, TOTW High Prairie would be the best choice at its ingredients and price.

I also added 12oz of organic raisins, 6oz of dried blueberries, and one sliced banana.  These really did a lot to add body to the wine.  The wine has a pretty nice color, and decent ""legs"" as a result.  Adding banana is great because it gives some mouthfeel and legs to the wine without imparting any flavor.  I also aged it on 2oz of light toast american oak for about a month while it cleared.  Then I let it sit in the carboy for another month - bottling day was about three months from the day I started the kit, and the wine has been in bottles for two months now.  What I've ended up with is a nice, fruit forward wine, with a subtle hint of oak.  I'm pretty pleased for only two bucks a bottle.  I've been making wine for less than a year and have done a few high end kits as well.  While the Vino Italian kits are definitely not in the same class, they can produce some nice ""every day"" wines, or give you something to drink while your nicer wines age.

Donofrio,49/53,1.0,1318550400,DISAPPOINTED ***UPDATED***,"***UPDATE #2***<br />It seems that Amoretti has made a new flavor: Amoretti Premium Pumpkin PIE Syrup<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099AUJBW"">Amoretti Premium Pumpkin Pie Syrup (750mL)</a><br />I haven't tried it but the reviews look promising. Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review, I received a call from one of the owners of the company.  He apologized for my disappointment and offered to replace my product with another.  When I finally spoke to him several days later, I had received some other syrups that I must say, exceeded my expectations.<br />I was never into vanilla, caramel or hazelnut flavors before but I didn't realize why.  Comparing these flavors to the others I have tried in the past (namely, Torani) the Amoretti syrups tasted ""real"" and not like a chemical.  What is unique about their flavors is they are not overly sweet but they are full of flavor. I know I am not writing a review for the other flavors so I still hold my opinion that the pumpkin spice has no pumpkin flavor (I suggested to Paul on the phone that he consider changing the name to SPICE and leave out PUMPKIN entirely) however I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good the other flavors are.  So much so, that I brought my opened bottles of Torani to work to leave in the breakroom.<br />I am still hoping that Amoretti makes a pumpkin pie sauce syrup and if so, I will be first in line to buy it.<br />As for my other comments about the packaging, the new products I received were sealed with a plastic sleeve around the caps and the cap seals worked better too.  I still prefer a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle but seeing a change in the packaging so quickly based on customer comments was impressive.<br />As for the Amoretti flavors I would strongly suggest....Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup, Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup and Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup. I have never had creme syrups before and these are delicious.  I used the caramel and vanilla creme syrups over pumpkin and apple pies so they double as a dessert sauce too.  I have never been into flavored coffees before (with the exception of trying to recreate Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice Latte) and now I find myself having a flavored latte every morning.  My next Amoretti syrups will be the chocolate creme and the orange cream.<br />As I told Paul on the phone, good customer service is lacking in this country and he has set the bar for excellent customer service; he could teach other companies how to treat their customers.  I probably would have thrown away the pumpkin spice syrup and never tried another Amoretti product again, but now I am a loyal customer.<br />Conclusion:  Even though I did not like the Pumpkin Spice syrup, I do not feel like I wasted my money because the company made it right and replaced it with other flavors that I love.<br />Amoretti...please consider making a true pumpkin pie creme sauce (and perhaps a white mocha creme sauce) and I will never buy another brand or need to go to Starbucks again.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z86XZY"">Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z8E0WW"">Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z7X1F0"">Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br />This tastes exactly like the red hot cinnamon candies and I ABHOR those candies.  It doesn't even taste like real cinnamon but just like spicy cinnamon candy.  So I am still searching for Pumpkin Syrup.<br />I find it interesting that one other review mentioned the open cap.  Mine arrived the same way and I was hesitant about using the product because the cap came right off without breaking the plastic seal around the cap and there was no inner seal on the bottle.  The only reason I did use it was because I heard a slight vacuum sound when it opened.  Perhaps it was a false sense of security that could be due to changes in shipping elevations because typically, syrup bottles are not vacuum sealed but the company should consider an inner foil bottle seal and not rely on the cap."

I didn't notice much of a difference.  She didn't seem to be in pain or have diarrhea (as some owners have said).  Her outside routine didn't seem changed and there was no need for her to immediately get outside when she was through with the bone.  These are definitely a treat for our dog and one I would consider buying in the future"

I do not know if this was a fluke or just a bad batch but this was TERRIBLE<br /><br />I received the product in great time. It arrived in about 3 or 4 days and i gave half of the bag to my daughter. I used hemp seed mostly in my protein shakes. I've been taking hemp seed for about 4 months now. When I got this product, i used it in one of my shakes and 2 hours later I had horrible stomach pain and threw everything up. My stomach continued to feel horrible all day. I really didn't even think it was the shake, but a stomach virus at the time. Then 3 days later, my daughter called me and told me she got very sick, with similar symptoms. She had mentioned that it was a couple hours after drinking a shake she made with the hemp seed. At that point I was afraid to use to product, unsure if it was the hemp seed or my family had gotten a ""bug"" (by the way, my daughter does not live at home). So a month just passed and today I decided to give it another try. I made a shake and put 2 tablespoons of hemp seed in it (the recommended dosage is 3 but i only use 2 in my shakes). And then, like clockwork, 2 hours later i threw everything up and my stomach still feels horrible and i still feel nauseous. The expiration date of this product is December of 2012 so its not expired but there has to be something wrong with it.  To date, we've used about 6 tablespoons of this stuff and we haven't thrown the rest away in hopes the company will contact us and want it back for testing and give us a refund.

197353,B00636FDSE,A2CPM6WTF7PO3G,"Red Xala ""~23~""",2/2,3.0,1338076800,The unfortunate circumstances surrounding a once great Belgian ale...,"During the late 1990's and early 2000's, this was one of my favorites.  Back then, the 750ml bottle was the only option; I would purchase it to share with friends, trying to introduce them to something new in the beer world.  Strangely, the beer then left the Minnesota markets for a couple of years.  Needless to say I was quite displeased with this.  Despite my efforts, there was just no way that I could logistically get my hands on this now precious and coveted ale.  Then just a couple of years ago, Leffe resurfaced again - this time exclusively in 6 pack form.  Moreover, it was now in virtually every liquor store that carried at least a minimal selection of imported beers.  Although I was pleased that Leffe had returned, it just didn't feel quite right; it was now too ubiquitous, and I missed the old 750 ml corked bottles.  Now, in the past year or so, the 750ml bottles have returned.  Additionally, the sticker price is surprisingly much cheaper (approximately $4 - $6) than its Belgian competitors.  Once again, I was glad to see the return of the quintessentially Belgian corked bottle for Leffe.  However, the significantly reduced cost of the ale made me a bit suspicious.  Regardless, like reacquainting with an old friend, I decided to pick up a bottle to see if Leffe was still one of Belgium's finest.  While there is no doubt that Leffe is still a quality Belgian ale, there seems to be something slightly different with this product, some subtilities that seem to be lacking.  I noticed it mainly in the finish of the beer; there seemed to be a vaguely noticeable ""thinness"" that I've sometimes associated with cheaper quality American brews.  I started to ""smell a rat,"" so I decided to dig a little bit deeper into recent information about Leffe; what I uncovered made my heart sink a little bit...<br />It seems that one major step in the wrong direction for Leffe occurred in 2004.  It was during this time that Interbrew, the company that owned the rights to Leffe, merged with the Brazilian brewing company AmBev.  Changing the company name to InBev following the merger, the conglomerate earned itself a very negative reputation as a ruthless predator in the beer manufacturing world. It is also noteworthy to point out that this was roughly the same time period in which Leffe became conspicuously absent from the shelves of Minneapolis liquor stores.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but I'm willing to bet that it wasn't.  In November 2008, InBev purchased Budweiser giant Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. Changing the name to ""Anheuser-Busch InBev"" (or ""AB InBev"" for short), the newly formed conglomerate was now the world's #1 beer manufacturer.  Moreover, multiple resources that I read cited the fact that AB InBev was now using corn and other cost-effective measures in their brewing process for Leffe -- something that was not being done previously.  In one fell swoop, this explains the recent widespread distribution, the suspiciously low cost, and the noticeably different taste of a once great Belgian ale.  As I write this, I keep shaking my head; I feel a bit duped and betrayed (unfortunately, Leffe is just the tip of the iceberg - other quality beers such as Franziskaner, Bass,  Goose Island, and Hoegaarden are also owned by AB InBev).<br /><br />By most accounts that I've read, AB InBev seems to have garnered a reputation for buying up smaller beer companies and either callously altering their brewing processes (in the name of cost-effective measures) or working toward closing the products lines down altogether.  There's lots of negative information out there in regard to this company... I may need to reconsider how often ( if at all) I should purchase products that support such a dubious organization."

For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do."

They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.

Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered.

To be honest I found the soup to be neither hot nor sour, it was actually pretty sweet.<br /><br />So I decided to doctor it up by adding some lemon juice and some hot sauce to make it more hot and sour, and then it was a lot better. I also added some more veggies, tofu, and an organic egg to make it more hearty and filling.<br /><br />This soup is actually pretty high in fiber (8 grams) compared to regular ramen, and it's much lower in sodium (570mg).  So while the overall flavor was decent, the nutritional value of this ramen is better than most I have tried.<br /><br />Over all I think this soup was pretty enjoyable.  It's not nearly as cheap as regular ramen, but it has NO MSG, more fiber, and A LOT less sodium. It is also vegan.<br /><br />I would purchase this soup again.  To be honest, my personal favorite natural soup bowl is Annie Chun's Kimchi Soup, so if you are a die hard fan of ramen, but want to make a healthier choice, I would start with that one."

253049,B000PSTGKW,A29GHG0JNYVCUD,John Summerfield,0/2,5.0,1302652800,Salt Servers,"Salt Servers<br /><br />If like me, perhaps you have seen the salt servers shown on Alton Brown's programs or listed in his book ""Gear for Your Kitchen"".  We found two items on Amazon.  Viewer reviews suggested that both seemed to be the salt server used by Alton Brown.  Well I bought one; and then bought another that we found on Amazon.  Once received some issues existed with the first item purchased.  Better details apply to the second item.  Neither item includes any logo similar to the Amazon description.<br /><br />I plan to use both items, perhaps one for sea salt and the other for Kosher salt.  My spouse will decide the uses but first let me describe some differences.<br />First I bought a a salt server listed in Amazon as ""Salt Server / Cheese Bowl / Condiment Serving Bowl & Spoon Set - Fine Stainless Steel Serveware for Your Home"" for $20.00.  Some aspects of this product an opening in the top for a spoon and a spoon like a desert spoon that extends through the top lid with no seal around the spoon or the lid.  This item was received around 24 March, 2011.  My spouse applied plastic wrap to keep some of the moisture out of the salt.  This item may remain a salt server; or my spouse may find a better use.<br /><br />The Amazon description reflects functions for ""serving gourmet sea salt and kosher salt by your counter-top"".  The description also mentions ""serving Parmesan cheese for your Pasta, sugar for your tea, cranberry sauce for your turkey, chocolate sprinkles for your ice cream, Jalapeno peppers and salsa for your Mexican dishes, and condiments on your dining and buffet table.""  This sounds better than using it for salt.<br /><br />Then I bought the ""RSVP Endurance Salt Server with Spoon"" from Amazon for $18.95.  The purchase dates are the key for differentiating the two items.  This item was received 12 April 2011.  No hole exists in the lid for the spoon.  The spoon is much smaller and fits inside the container.  The lid has a gasket.  In my humble opinion, the RSVP model would be the only item to buy as a salt server although each could be used for other applications.  I give the RSVP item high marks, and less for the other."

I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.

She never quite figured out the ""tug"" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the ""tug"" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think."

It's very light (only 10g of sugars, no fat, no dairy and only 50 calories), and it's very bitter as compared to some other similar beverages. For instance, the 6.5 ounce can of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BZODI"">Starbucks DoubleShot</a> contains 17g of sugar, 6g of fat, and 140 calories. Even the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W4AF3G"">Starbucks Doubleshot Light</a> has 6g of sugar, 4g of fat and 70 calories. In terms of caffeine per serving, illy's espresso drink has about 155 mg as opposed to 130 for the Sturbucks drinks.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: if you want a strong, light, European-style espresso drink than illy's issimo is a great choice. However, if you enjoy smoother, more filling taste then check out the Starbucks' DoubleShots."

Each piece is 10 grams of carbohydrates so 3 pieces is all I need to get the sugars back to where they need to be. It is extremely portable as it is not perishable and will not melt in the summer heat of your car.

The company doesn't care....,"I thought this product was great, even if maybe it did not seem as pure as more expensive brands.  Then I decided to reuse one of the glass jars after I emptied the salt into a salt shaker today.  After peeling off the label, I realized that the jar had scratches in the glass on the INSIDE of the jar, with the serious potential for having glass particles mixed in with the salt.  I went to the next jar.  It is still safety sealed and unopened.  I peeled off the paper label from the outside of the jar, and inside the sealed jar there is a hair!  It looks like it could be a rat hair, but I have not tested it obviously.  I do hope the FDA will test it--I am contacting them in the morning.  This second jar also has numerous scratches in the glass--approximately 20 scratches, many of them black (dirt in the scratched glass).  The company was not at all concerned--they just told me if I didn't purchase it directly from them, I should ask amazon for a refund.  I explained that the main point of my call was certainly not for a refund but to protect consumers from DANGER!  They called me back and said IF I returned their jars, they would replace the salt.  I refused the replacement and am hoping the FDA will examine the jars.  It is a little alarming that Amazon has no procedure for pulling the salt from its shelves and checking the remaining jars.

The product is tasty, has a natural flavor, is easy to mix and contains only about 5 calories per 8 ounce glass.<br /><br />You should however be aware that one packet is meant to be mixed with your standard-sized 500 ml (aka 16.9 ounce) bottle of water.  I first mixed a glass of this with about 8 oz of water and it was much too strong.  So expect one packet to make about two 8 ounce glasses.<br /><br />I've seen substantial price fluctuations on this product.  I paid around $16 with Subscribe and Save and I just saw that it went on sale for even less than what I paid.  So if your price is anywhere around what I paid, it's a good deal.<br /><br />What I can tell you is that you'll get a lot of ""tea"" for the money without a doubt.  Let's do the math.  You will get about two 8 oz glasses per packet and there are 12 packets per box and you'll receive 10 boxes from Amazon.  Thus 12, 16.9 oz servings per box times 10 boxes equals 2,028 ounces or 254 8oz servings.  You could drink a glass of tea per day for almost 9 months before you'd run out.  That's a lot of ""tea"" for sure!<br /><br />The reason that I've been writing the word ""tea"" in quotation marks is because I can't really taste the tea.  It doesn't really taste like a mix of lemonade and iced tea aka the ""Arnold Palmer.""  It just tastes like lemonade to my tastebuds, even though there is tea in it, according to the listed ingredients.  So it is very good, but do understand what you are purchasing.  The tea taste is very subtle.<br /><br />But again, I really like it.  Nestea Lemon Sticks have a natural lemon flavor and are sweet without having the usual artificial flavor or aftertaste.  It mixes quite easily and requires minimal stirring.  Plainly, as noted, you get a whole lot of tea with a Amazon's 10 box offering.  At less than 5 calories for an 8 ounce serving, it is refreshing and sweet while adding minimal calories.<br /><br />Let me also tell you something that it's great for if you drink adult beverages.  I have mixed this product with Sweet Tea Vodka and it's fantastic.  It's basically like an Arnold Palmer for grown-ups.  Just make the product like you normally would and blend to taste with the Sweet Tea Vodka of your choice.<br /><br />Finally, I'm very happy to report that this product contains *NO SODIUM*!  Sorry about the caps, but one of my pet peeves is the fact that nearly every diet beverage has a ton of added sodium.  If you don't believe me, just take a look at the ingredients on the diet soda of your choosing and you'll typically see 5% or more of your RDA of sodium in a 12 ounce can.  Who needs that?!  We consume far too much salt as it is!  I can understand a bit of salt with your dinner, but I don't want it in my beverages.  Even most iced tea that you'll find in the stores has a good dose of added sodium.  This product has none and it still tastes great.<br /><br />Thanks Nestea for an excellent new product!  I highly recommend it!<br /><br />OK, and here's the bonus low calorie lemon drop recipe (my own creation):<br /><br /> 1. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice<br /> 2. Add 2 shots vodka<br /> 3. Add 1 packet Nestea Lemonade (10 calories)<br /> 4. Add 3/4 cup to 1 cup water to taste<br /><br />Shake like crazy.<br /><br />Tastes great and almost no calories other than what's in the vodka."

The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips Ahoy did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br /><br />I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br /><br />These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br /><br />Given that the chocolate ""fudge"" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)"

I have tried many types of popcorn salt, but have found the ACT II to be the best. Several points that make this a superior popcorn salt. First, the salt is ground down to a very fine texture. Because of this, it sticks very well to the popcorn. It sticks better than regular salt and better than other popcorn salts I have tried. The salt ends up on the popcorn, and not in the bottom of the bowl. Second, this seasoning has the perfect blend of salt/butter flavor. The salt enhances the flavor of the popcorn perfectly, creating that wonderful movie popcorn flavor.<br /><br />The key with this salt is to learn the proper proportion to shake on. Play around with it, and you will fine tune the proportion to your taste, and will then be enjoying movie popcorn at a small fraction of the price at the theater."

I was hoping it would be some kind of mythical Asian flower or something interesting, but no.  My quick look-see around the Interweb revealed only that it's the name of this Singapore-based ongoing business concern, involved with Tasty® Singapore, which is an initiative of the government-sponsored International Enterprise Singapore, an effort to promote Singaporean food businesses worldwide (which has a very colorful and very loud website).  And Tasty has got a nice, smiley kind of logo, too (see image).<br /><br />If the good folks at Gold Kili want this and their other products to take off in the US, they really need to work on their packaging.  The copy on the envelope is not very good, a bit awkward, coming off as having been developed by someone whose first language is not English (like Singapore Chinese).  The instructions open with ""For hot serving...""  Well, I figure that has to do with heated water, but the 8th grader in me also instantly recognized a distinct yet seriously divergent possible type of serving method.  But I digress.  Knowing most Americans, the preparation text needs to be much more clear, with very concrete instructions, like starting with, ""Pour contents into a cup...""  Second, the only measure of how much water to use is in metric.  I'm down with the metric, yo, but most Americans are most definitely not, so you've got to actually tell them to put 8 ½ ounces into their coffee mug.<br /><br />Note that 8.5 ounces really isn't that much.  It's more or less a standard coffee cup, but in bigger-is-better America, that's only half a mug.  I recommend Gold Kili up-size their portions for the US market.<br /><br />Man, that ginger scent--strong--comes barreling right out right away when you open the envelope, and then when you stir it up, a very distinctive aroma.  The scent is quite good, a very nice alternative to coffee; brewing up a lot of this would be a very nice aroma throughout the house.  And so how did it taste?  Well, it was sweeter than I expected, which was a relief.  That unmistakable ginger taste is really strong, that pungent, stinging taste, spicy and quite insistent.  If you've had Asian ginger candy and can take it and like it, this product will work for you.  I do think that most Americans will not take to this, as it is a most definitely foreign and highly specialized ethnic taste, something they've only gotten the slightest hint of at their local bland Zap Wok restaurant.  The lemon flavor is there, albeit rather subtle.  You get the lemon mostly in the aftertaste.  You do get a very distinct and lingering ginger aftertaste of the drink, and that unmistakable low-level burn of ginger at the back of your throat.  It stays with you for some time, even after drinking or eating something else.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty good hot, but is NOT good cold.  For testing purposes, I added nothing to the drink, no sugar, nothing additional; I think doing so would ruin it.<br /><br />My experience with the drink's color was not what you see on the package, which appears to be a kind of semi-clear green tea.  It is very unclear if this is in fact some kind of tea.  All the envelope tells you is that it's ginger lemon drink, and that's all.  There's no more info on the packaging.  The actual color is a kind of ruddy brown, much like a tea.<br /><br />And hey, in the grandest tradition of Indians, Chinese and Malays (and generations of colonial descendants) living so peaceably together in lovely, sterile, boring yet successful Singapore, this product is in fact halal.  Yay.  There are no kosher markings.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you've spent time in Asia, and are up for something more than the ubiquitous, overpriced fare at Starbucks, this one will work for you as a morning drink.  For those not used to full-on ginger, this make take some adjustment.  The ginger taste is powerful, so is a good pick-up, although this product is caffeine-free.  It'll be a welcome product for Asians and those used to strong ginger products, but will take some getting used to for most Westerners."

They had this on sale at my local grocery store for about $4.99 a can so Amazon is a little cheaper in that area but I didn't want to buy a pack of 3 not knowing what I was getting into. I'm not really a coffee snob (nor a coffee expert, mind you) but just for the heck of it, I love to try different brands of coffee and try not to stick with one no matter how good it tastes.<br /><br />This Maxwell House Original blend smells really good and doesn't lack in flavor. My first sip of this coffee instantly reminded me of Yuban Colombian coffee. I actually got addicted to coffee because of Yuban and surprisingly, Maxwell House Original blend closely resembles it, which is a good thing although Yuban is stronger. I'm not sure what kind of beans is used here but if my taste buds are correct, I'll go with some type of Colombian beans.<br /><br />I made this coffee using a Black and Decker Brew N' Go machine, a single cup Melitta filter and a Bodum french press. Each cup came out awesome except for one very weird thing. The cup of coffee starts out really good but then towards the later half or so, it starts to decrease in flavor. I'm using the suggested 1 tablespoon of coffee grinds for every 6oz of water (I usually drink 12oz at a time so I use 2 tablespoon) so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that the coffee can comes with a flavor lock lid. It's too early for me to tell if this lid truly does help preserve the coffee grinds over time so it will be interesting to test this out. All in all, this is a good coffee product and I now want to try the Maxwell House French Roast because it seems that one is the more popular product."

To them so confused I ask<br /><br />Cooking?<br /><br />Each day at least once a day, I draw forth my serrated knife, and one sacrificial box of this excellent tofu, and I without remorse slice a hole in its top, with great tenderness and care and gratitude, releasing only the slightest and most apologetic gentle spurt of clearest liquid.<br /><br />And this with a certain yearning.<br /><br />I do not observe the indications written sternly upon the short edge of the box, but lie this box gently down upon a smooth flat slab of wood, with the face up, and take the knife very gently sliding upon on edge of the top, the very belly of the box, and then upon the other edge of this top, and then most gently along the bottom edge of this top, each time releasing apologetically the slightest hint of a clear liquid, revealing thusly by means of these three slits the gentle hidden secrets of the box, the soft white substance lying shyly within, awaiting with embarrassment our further processing.<br /><br />I feel the need to explain this procedure with greater care and attention. The very tip, the point of the knife, uncovers tenderly a certain point a certain distance from the corner of the broad top of the box, the side with the picture and product label, as pictured here, the side which reads Morinu, the broad flat side laid flat. The very tip of the knife, I say, discovers probingly a certain point near one corner which offers the proper resistance without too great a resistance, without too little a resistance, to penetrate this membrane. Too close to the corner is found to be too hard, too resistant, too unwilling, although most convenient for the later proceedings. Too distant from the corner implies simply random slashings without specific purpose, and our purpose in this procedure is most serious, most purposeful, intent.<br /><br />In a word therefore the point of the knife penetrates the membrane slowly yet purposefully as close to the corner as possible, penetrating as deeply as possible without piercing the wooden slab beneath. A certain spurt of clear liquid may emerge, but let this prove no inhibition, as the knife reaches the depth of the box. Slowly withdraw the knife, slowly, at a diagonal, allowing the serration softly with friction to continue to separate a slight slit along the ege of the box, slowly, resolutely but patiently, with purpose, as the serration creates an ever longer slit along that edge, as closely as possible.<br /><br />Continue from this first slit along the the contiguous edge of the top of this box, and then the third edge, inserting carefully your knife, and slowly withdrawing with a friction sufficient to separate the membrane without shredding, without eliciting over muchly the clear liquid which may spurt forth.<br /><br />Let us call the top right corner of the box Point A, the bottom right corner Point B, the left bottom corner Point C and the upper left corner Point D. Begin to pierce at Point A, proceed in turn to B, to C, ending at D, forming this a slit along the three edges. Arriving at Point D, withdraw the knife completely, wipe the blade with a soft, dry cloth and set it aside for cleansing. We now may lift the flap thus created, exposing the delicate white contents within.<br /><br />I feel remiss if I do not address a probable misconception here writtenonly for the rhetorical convenience, and I feel compelled by the necesity of correcting this counter-indication, no matter how unclear this may be, due only to my severely limiting literary incapacities.<br /><br />Employing the same alphabetical coordinates as described above, the consumer may discover this procedure far more efficacious: to begin at Point A and proceed gently yet firmly to point B as described. Divergently, however, please proceed to point D (!) and then directly by knife edge to point C, parallel to the Line AB already created, yet along the opposing edge. Having thusly formed two parallel slits, find the midpoint between Point B and Point C as close to the edge as possible, probing and then plunging the tip of the knife through the cardboard membrane, through to the bottom of the box, but now with an orientation perpendicular to that previously used in the formation of lines AB and DC. Withdraw slowly, delicately, yet with sufficient friction at an angle to proceed effectively to the corner at Point B. Withdraw completely and reverse the knife blade, returning it deeply at the midpoint previously entered. Withdraw once more with similar care, and opposite diagonal, completing the slit thus formed entirely to Point C. I am confident the consumer may discover this procedure far more delightful and effective than any here previously described.<br /><br />Firmly we roll back the top flap created by the three slits. Proceed mercilessly, proceed, not frenetically, but ardently nevertheless, to dice within the selfsame box her contents, slowly, gently, but decisively. The fresh tip of my serrated knife, which in recent memory has touched no animal part, but vegetable alone, and never shall become so adulterate with the blood of the animal, with the dairy of the animal, this sanctified and reserved and faithful tip, having never known in any sense animal but only vegetable, purified thus, unadulterate, this sacred knife dares therefore pierce this gentle pure white tofu into a ruthless grid of slits, fully through to the bottom box, plunging first vertically in rhythmically repeated rows spaced gently a few centimeters apart, and then, relentlessly, horizontally, pushing ever so softly through the yielding, unresisting white tofu laid back upon the flat slab, awaiting without a word this process, with utter patience, yielding.<br /><br />Completed this repeated slicing, back and forth, up and down, across, and through, and through, I lift in one hand upwards the entire box gently, yet unrelentingly, over the recipient reserved for this purpose alone. Most often it is the daily lunch container, reusable, with soft top, to receive the more securely and gently this daily offering, removed demurely from its box, as cautiously as a hermit crab from its borrowed shell, vulnerable by exposure. With one finger one may remove whatever residue remains relunctly within the package, passing it reassuringly into the ultimate recipient.<br /><br />Lime juice freshly squeezed upon the tofu deposited there, as ablution, meets fragrant sprigs of fresh green cilantro mated with whole Corriander Seeds 7oz, and a generous ladling of the Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12) also available upon this generously nutrient amazon. This is a meal in itself, and comes most welcome at noon.<br /><br />At night rather than such a cold lunch, in this cold winter a warmer meal is wanted, and so this gentle and yielding box of nutritious tofu might discover herself pushed gently into a saucepan of simmering miso soup, such as, perhaps, Shiro Miso Paste NON GMO No MSG Added. This miso soup would take far greater space to describe here in the making. From this container of miso paste draw forth a goodly spoonful to introduce slowly, most politely, into a gently heating small saucepan of water. Later, in place of seaweed and to deceive my own palate, I place those small flat spinach leaves available in the organic department of your local market, perhaps with the results of a small onion diced very carefully in the manner approved as described above, or green onion.<br /><br />When quite ready for dinner, I add last of all to this essence this gentle box of tofu, sliced as described above, with great and tender care, leaving it bathing one might dare say, only long enough to warm through and through, before eating.<br /><br />A veritable meal in itself.<br /><br />There are so many other manners in which to use, and to abuse, this pure, white and utterly nutritious gentle product, and I can only with my utmost recommendation say, and this with my greatest gratitude, that here at long last we may know a food most willingly fit for our human consumption, and one most readily available upon this wonderful amazon.<br /><br />Great shelf life in this packaging, patiently awaiting your most tender mercies and privileged attentions, but out here in this desert I still keep it in the fridge!"

I'm no tea expert, but I've got several problems with it.  Flavor-wise, I find this tea to be bitter with a grassy taste (that's not a good flavor, to me).  Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).  Also, the wide range of textures indicates (to me) that these tea leaves might not necessarily have been chosen for inclusion.  Instead, it feels like they might just have been leftovers from other processes (that's merely my non-knowledgeable feelings and not based on any hard facts).

Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker.

I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me that this flavor, the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."

Compared to a packet of potato chips, the Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews have more fat, more saturated fat, more sugar, fewer vitamins, and only slightly more fiber.<br />I didn't care for the taste, either, though my husband enjoyed them. They were too salty for me, and the flavor didn't seem natural.<br />They were nice as an ingredient in stir-fry, though.<br />If you want to incorporate more nuts into your snacks but really you wish you were eating barbecue chips, then this might be a transitional food for you."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

It may have been a looming expiration date (I bought 12 of the large bags about three months ago) but as I noticed each new bag having more and more hard chips, I quickly gave them all away thinking that at least someone should enjoy them before they completely go bad because there was no way I would get around to eating that many by myself. So I can't check to see if that was the problem or not but after seeing how many reviews talk about this issue, I'm thinking it's pretty prevalent.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to find a single bag to purchase because while buying in bulk tends to be cheaper, you're just wasting money if you end up throwing a bunch away because it's gone stale.<br /><br />But other than the staleness, I LOVE these chips!"

Dr. Stephen Rennard at the University of Nebraska Medical Center states that ""chicken soup acts as an anti-inflammatory. The soup, he says, keeps a check on inflammatory white blood cells (neutrophils). Cold symptoms, such as coughs and congestion, are often caused by inflammation produced when neutrophils migrate to the bronchial tubes and accumulate there.""  Many other studies promote chicken soup and broth for health and well being.  Progresso recently came out with a 100% natural unsalted chicken broth.  Heavy salt content is usually a good reason to steer clear of the various commercial soups at your supermarket.  When a soup says it is unsalted, that usually means it doesn't taste good.  No so with the new Progresso chicken broth. The broth has a golden color and full flavor.  It does not taste watered down.  In fact, it is delicious, at least in my opinion.  When used in cooking, with rice for example, it enhances the flavor of the rice.<br /><br />Some facts taken from the soup carton:<br />Calories per serving -- 25.  Total fat -- 0g.  Cholesterol -- 0%  Sodium -- 125mg, 5% of daily recommended amount (so the broth does have some salt).  Protein -- 4g. Potassium -- 240mg.<br />Total carbs -- 2g.<br /><br />This broth appears to be a tasty alternative to a cup of green tea for those health minded folks who want some variety in their choice of beverages.

Harris ""Film aficionado""",0/0,2.0,1338854400,This Illi Issimo Drink Packs A Strange Combination Of Sweet And Bitter,"Through the years, I've tried just about every pre-made coffee beverage imaginable. I am a coffee lover and enthusiast, so I'm married to the idea of buying a can or bottle of a delicious coffee based product that I'll live happily ever after with. My experiences, however, have yet to yield bliss. Some are just fine, but nothing has ever made me say ""Wow! I'd like to drink this all the time!"" I had heard some positive things about the illy issimo brand, so given the opportunity--I sampled both their Caffe and their Cappuccino.<br /><br />Caffe (2 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink. At first, I thought this drink had a strong and pronounced coffee flavor. But something is slightly off. The more I drank, it seemed too sweet and too bitter at once, which is a strange and not altogether pleasant combination. As it is essentially comparable to drinking an iced espresso, it may not be as palatable as some of their other creations. But, it's not really something that I would sample again. And at an approximate cost of $2.00 per can (only 6.8 ounce), this serves more as a caffeine boost than a refreshing beverage. Made with real Arabica coffee, I was also intrigued by the ""Do Not Shake"" warning which left me with the unappetizing visual of the particulate matter that must still be in the liquid drink (fine for Turkish coffee, not so appealing for something in a can).<br /><br />Cappucino (3 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Espresso Style Coffee Drink with Lowfat Milk and Cocoa. So, at 8.45 ounces this is a slightly bigger drink. As some of the harshness is buffered by the milk and cocoa combination, this one easily had a more pleasant taste. Still, a bit sweet for my liking but better overall. I'm still not blown away and I won't be a regular purchaser of this, or any illi issimo brand drinks, but I didn't dislike this one. Nice enough once in a while, but not inspiring enough to purchase a case. I guess I'll remain a fresh made kind of coffee drinker! KGHarris, 6/12."

I am only saying this because I used the 2 different products together. The outcome might (and probably would have) been better if I had both the shampoo and conditioner.

More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well."
247137,B0041PEES4,A3V1A3C9DTLPME,Peter Faden,2/2,4.0,1310083200,It is a cactus. :),"Seriously though, for my order, it took about eight days to receive it. When i did, what i got was an eight inch tall dragon fruit cactus with two nub offshoots. It was definitely not ""fruiting size"" as advertised, nor was it even close to nine pounds as advertised. For these reasons, i give the whole thing four stars.<br /><br />Now, the positives: It has continued to grow, and the offshoots are both much larger than they started out (they've gone from being little nubs too being 3 1/2 inches and 2 inches long respectively). A third has also begun to grow. It is definitely quite healthy, and i look forward to it's continued growth and future flower and fruit production. Although not exactly as advertised, i am pleased with the plant itself. I plan to move it indoors for the winters, but for now, it is thriving on my porch. Judging from past dragon fruit cacti i have seen, i would recommend getting this bad boy in a larger pot sooner than later if you are in a winter state, and dont plan to put it in the ground. They get quite large, and i wouldnt want to be messing with a transplant later when it can hurt to move it. :)<br /><br />Update June 17 2012: The first year didnt really see my plant doing much at all. Two ""arms"" grew out sideways, but were too heavy for themselves and broke off eventually, although about 8 inches of one arm remained intact. Brought it in for the winter, and then moved it into a larger pot once winter ended. Now, there are all kinds of new ""buds"" growing off both the main body of the cactus and the arm as well. This was a welcome change, and indicated that mine at least, needed a little time to adjust to the climate or somesuch. Anyway, I'm excited to see what comes of all this new growth. I'm adding some stakes, as suggested by Mr. Fugate, whose reviews were helpful and informative to me personally, so hopefully the new growth will grow out along the sakes and not weigh themselves down."

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because ""it's good for the cats and they love it"". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to ""fatten her up"" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet."

Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  ""caveat emptor."""

Will consider this more or less neutral since it's not great but certainly not bad either.<br /><br />Now for the thing that I don't really like...the vitamins. Yes, there is a nice range of vitamins and at first glance, that sounds fine BUT, the quality of the included vitamins is questionable. For example, for B12, cyanocobalmin is used rather than the more expensive (and bioavailable) methylcobalmin. To be perfectly fair, the vast majority of people probably won't/don't care and the idea of taking in some vitamins at all is an improvement. However, those that are health conscious and/or only use bioavailable forms of vitamins will be disappointed.

On researching it, I found that it became popular in Britain during WW2 because there were few other sources of vitamin C available to British children during the war and this berry was suitable for growing in the UK climate.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the taste of blackcurrant to anyone who hasn't tasted it, only that it's a little like grape juice but without any tartness or aftertaste and quite sweet. I can't really compare it with anything else since it just simply taste better than any time of grape or berry juice that I've ever had. I can only say that it's great tasting and you must try it. On top of this flavorful goodness, blackcurrants are also rich in vitamins and anti-oxidants; it's almost like hamburgers which are good for you, or cigarettes which prolong your life, something too good to be true! You can drink it cooled in the fridge or hot with hot water and it tastes good both ways!<br /><br />When I was a kid I used to drink shots of it in a shot glass mixed with only 2-3 parts of water, ahh the memories... and the abuse my pancreas must have taken... As I see from other reviews, most Americans who love this love it for nostalgia's sake having had it as a child overseas. Well, it really is as good as nostalgia and I'm glad I can find it through Amazon today."

I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered online.  Delivery took 1.5 to 2 weeks, but I was not disappointed.  It arrived in a foil pouch, as shown on the photo.  I transferred some to a small spice shaker bottle, and stored the remainder in the foil pouch, enclosed in a ziploc bag.  First, I tried pouring it into the spice bottle from the foil pouch, but spilled quite a bit on the counter.  If you plan to transfer to small containers, I suggest spooning/scooping it out into the container of your choice.  I also immediately made a 16oz cup of cinnamon tea, with one teaspoon cinnamon.  I love this cinnamon!  It smells and tastes wonderful.  The flavor is milder than ""regular"" cinnamon, which to me, is a good thing.  The texture looks and feels like powder, so it mixes very well.  I can't wait to try this in other recipes.<br /><br />Some have commented on the price of this cinnamon, but when I compare to what I've been paying for organic tea, the tea I make with this cinnamon is half the cost of the organic tea I've been buying in bulk.  ...and this tea smells much better.<br /><br />I definitely plan to purchase this cinnamon again.<br /><br />Update:  7Feb2012  I now add this cinnamon to my coffee, hot chocolate, and protein shakes.. and love the added flavor!  My favorite way to drink this as tea is about 1 teaspoon (or less) of cinnamon, 16 oz of hot water, and lemon juice.  This makes a healthy, delicious tea.  Cinnamon has also been shown to reduce glucose levels, triglycerides, and cholesterol. The smell of cinnamon supposedly also improves cognitive ability.. so I keep it around while my kids study.  I can't tell whether it's working, but they are happier and more alert while studying."

The hot was very tasty, and I did not need to add sweetener to it because the vanilla balanced the blackberry flavor nicely, with just a hint of sweetness. The little triangle bag the tea comes in did not tear and was easy to take out of my mug when I was done steeping the tea.

Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling.

I figured that they would be very close to the same, if not exactly. They are the same brand after all. But I was wrong. This one isn't anything like the other. It is bright yellow to start with. Drinking neon yellow milk is not too appetizing. The taste was completely different. too. I'm not sure how to explain the taste of this one. Except yuck. Ya it is vanilla, tho. But there is some  kind of weird after taste. If you are going to be purchasing this for a child, especially if it is to try to get them to drink their milk, I  would reccomend it. A child wouldn't be bothered by the yellow color. They might even think it's cool. But if you are like me and are trying to replace the ""very vanilla"" that Nesquik recently discontinued. DON'T. I wish I hadn't. I even purchased an entire case! Big mistake. Oh Ya. One more thing. The writing on the can is mostly Spanish. There is some English but it is not the main language. It is like under the Spanish-just incase we need it. You know how they do with the merchandise here (in the USA); they have a small Spanish translation under the English word. It is the same on this, but reversed. Spanish is the main language. The directions are even in Spanish.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you:)"

Zhang,0/2,5.0,1255824000,Green Tea Helps You Lose Weight,"Green Tea Helps You Lose Weight<br /><br />Green tea is believed to be a potential agent, which can help you to lose weight. Weight loss has become a serious matter in the present world. The possible reasons for weight loss can be many such as lifestyle factors, the diet and stress and strain the modern life. Irrespective of the possible reasons, there is a need for an ultimate solution since the weight gain or obesity can lead to many serious health hazards such as diabetes, and the heart diseases. Green tea is projected as an effective weight loss remedy since many of the reports show positive effects.<br /><br />Nature green tea is better than artificial greens tea product<br /><br />Green tea is primarily appreciated for the weight loss since it is a natural substance. Now, many artificial products are available in the market, claiming that are effective for weight loss. Since most of them manifested side effects, people have started searching for reliable natural products. Green tea is an herbal decoction, which is made from the unfermented leaves of Camellia sinensis. It is a proven stimulant that is regularly used as a beverage in the eastern countries. It is postulated that the green tea have medicinal properties and the traditional medicinal systems support the argument with evidences. It can be used to protect the heart, liver, skin, pancreas, oral systems and most importantly as a curative for cancer. However, the effectiveness of the green tea to lose weight cannot be proved from the medicinal properties. But, the scientific crowd is relying on the active ingredients of the green tea.<br />How green tea promote weight loss<br /><br />Green tea is recommended for the diet aid mainly because of its multifaceted effects on health. The major active component that attributes the properties to the green tea are the polyphenols such as catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, gallaogatechin, epigallocatechin, and apigallocatechin gallate (known as EGCG). Even though it have alkaloids such as caffeine, the EGCG is effective to compensate their effect and trigger the metabolism rate. The studies show that EGCG, which is a natural antioxidant, is also an effective thermogenic that can burn off the calories. Using the green tea, energy expenditure and metabolic rate is hiked at a rate of 4%, which will certainly help you for weight loss.<br /><br />Green tea catechins will also acts as a glucose regulator. It regulates the insulin level in the body and inhibits the sudden rise of insulin in the body after the food, which may initiate the fat conversion. The lowering of the insulin level prevents the sugar level rise and the fat storage, which ultimately prevent the weight gain. And, the influence in blood sugar level has proven some effect in the appetite level, also. The continuous intake of green tea is suspected to decrease the appetite, which naturally contribute to the weight loss.<br /><br />To add on, if you do not even count any of the above attributes of herbal green tea too, a simple factor will certainly add a cutting edge to green tea. If you are lenient enough to just substitute the usual morning drink, which is rich with calories, with a cup of green tea itself can definitely help you lose weight.<br />How to use green tea for your diet<br /><br />The easiest way to include green tea in your diet is to drink it. However, you could also use greentea extract pill and green tea patch.<br /><br />Drink green tea - This is the best way and the most effect way to get the full benefit from green tea. Since it is still unknown which anti-oxide in green tea encourage fat loss, it is the best to take it with its original form. The easiest way is to put green tea bag in hot water and let it rest for 3 to 4 minutes. However, you could also try LIPTON Diet Green Tea with Citrus or LIPTON Diet Green Tea with mix barriers (most believe commercial tea product contain only small amount of tea)<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OHVCIQ"">Kancura Herb Slimming Tea + Genseng Tea</a><br /><br />The end"

The dried Acai is better if it has time to soak up some liquid.  I usually mix my Muesli, acai and yogart the night before and refridgerate overnight.  I love it!  The acai gives the mix a berry flavor, but not a LOT of flavor, just adds to whatever flavor is already there.  If it has time to soak, you can't tell it's there (texture wise).  If it doesn't, it's a little grainy.  Overall a great product.  sealed fresh, delivered fast, and a great deal."

Deau,0/0,5.0,1329523200,These green capsules work flawless on my Delonghi machine and are tasty!,"I bought these pods along with the Delonghi Latissima 720 machine and they work flawless. They did fit the machine and are perfectly ejected after use.<br />It seems that some Amazon customers are giving bad reviews for this product because it is cheaper and it's not Nespresso, which is not the point.<br />Firstly, these capsules are green and compostable. They cannot be a ""copy"" of Nespresso pods that are in aluminum, which is highly polluting. ECC capsules would be a ""copy"" if they were made in aluminum too!<br />Secondly, the ECC capsules are not that cheap, there is only a difference of 10 cents between Nespresso and ECC: I am not sure that people that bought a Nespresso machine and used to drink Nespresso pods are interested in a bargain of 10 cents because if they wanted to make real savings, they should have used ground coffee and stovetop espresso makers!!!<br /><br />As a result,<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR YOU IF:<br />* you already have your favorite Nespresso ""grand crus"",<br />* you like the look of the aluminum capsules,<br />* you love George Clooney Nespresso commercials and keep saying ""What else?"" each time you drink a Nespresso coffee,<br />* you have the feeling to buy something luxurious each time you go to Nespresso club and you like it,<br />* you don't care about the planet.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU IF:<br />* you don't have a favorite Nespresso ""grand crus"", and you like espressos in general,<br />* you are not convinced by the recycling Nespresso thing because they did not try really hard to increase 5% of the total current recycled capsules(1),<br />* you think that ECC capsules is the answer to the Nespresso question ""What else?"",<br />* you like the idea of doing REALLY something to reduce the amount of polluting materials in your daily waste and think that recycling aluminum is not enough,<br />* you don't care about the Nespresso club.<br /><br />(1) If Nespresso/Nestle did care that much about recycling, they would have entice their customers by giving them coupons for empty capsules brought back (as for the recycle of glass for example).<br /><br />Another thing, I saw a lot of reviews saying that these green pods do not work on Citiz or Nespresso branded machines. I am not even surprised. Nestle made everything he could to prevent the Ethical coffee Company to sell their products, but ECC found success in Europe since 2010. If this product was not working and was responsible for breaking machines, we should know it! As a consequence, I am not a conspiracy person but I would not be suprised that some of the bad reviews could come from Nestle itself. We are in an espresso-capsule-war, so this is business!<br /><br />P.S. 1 : I am not working for the Ethical Coffee Company and they don't give me any money for rating their products. I am just a green costumer concerned about his carbon footprint.<br />P.S. 2 : The espresso taste is good! I used to drink espressos and ristrettos from semi automatic professional machines at work, but I did not want to do all the process by myself, so espresso capsule process is the perfect alternative for me! I am not a Nespresso aficionado so I am just talking about espresso here.<br />P.S. 3 : You have to firmly lower the level of your machine with these capsules. FIRMLY. The first time I tried, I was afraid time to break my Delonghi super expensive machine, but it's ok. It's seems to be due to the biodegradable capsule material that is less hard than aluminum (obvious).<br />P.S. 4 : It would be nice if the Ethical Coffee Company could put all theirs different products in a single degustation box, in this way you could choose your favorite flavors and only buy them. Because if you do not like the taste you are stuck with 49 capsules... it's a bit rude!<br />P.S. 5 : It would be great (and logical) if the ECC capsules were really ethical: organic and/or fair trade certified.<br /><br />>>April, 25th 2012<br />After drinking ECC capsules for more than 2 months now, my conclusion is that -- at comparable intensities and blends -- the espresso tastes of both Nespresso and ECC capsules are good, and the differences between Nespresso and ECC are subtle. Since some capsules are compostable while other pollute like hell, I will stick with these green capsules because I hope soon to turn them (coffee+capsules) in compost for my palm trees.<br /><br />>>May, 2nd 2012<br />I've just started to compost the ECC capsules, I am very excited! The capsules should break down in 6 months according to the standard EN#13432.<br />I will let you know how quick they turn into compost! :)<br /><br />Go green!"

They were everything a lemon drop should be: A sugary entrance, developing into a deeply satisfying, soul-stirring essence of pure lemon. The mouth-watering joy of the lemon drop is seductive and addictive, and I am nearly certain that sucking on these golden gems made Kurosawa's ""Savage Dogs"" even more enjoyable.<br /><br />They're hard candies. but not so hard that you couldn't cheat and bite into one, breaking it up into ten or so smaller candies, zig-zagging around your mouth like offshoots from a single magnificent fireworks explosion.<br /><br />One 2-ounce tin lasted longer than the 2 hours or so of Kurosawa's brilliant detective drama, one of his first with Toshiro Mifune, who once again delivers a compelling performance.  Although the packaging is a bit precious, there's nothing pretentious about the taste of Les Citrons, and as for value, these drops are the working man or woman's workhorse.  They're far less expensive than other candy (to say nothing of popcorn), and their staying power is extraordinary.<br /><br />Still, this vendor charges more than some others, and with the added shipping fee one may wish to purchase these  at a local outlet (or occupying it until your lemon drop demands are met).

And it gets ridiculously frothy when shaken up, like the entire bottle is foam.  What I do now is make a bottle at least a few hours ahead of time and stick it in the fridge, by the time I need to use it, the air bubbles are gone.<br /><br />My baby is not a picky eater at all, so I can't comment on the taste of it.<br /><br />Update:  My baby is now 7 months and takes about 16-18 oz of formula a day.  We noticed that she had been spitting up a lot since increasing her feedings, she would spit up without fail after a feeding, not matter how well she was burped and she would spit up again, sometimes 3 more times in the next hour.  When I happened to run out of this brand and had to use some similac, the spitting up nearly disappeared.  If I had to guess it's due to all the foam in the bottle, but perhaps it's one of the ingredients?  As I mentioned in the above review, the amount of shaking that has to be done to dissolve the formula is ridiculous.  Even with very warm water and a lot of shaking we'll have lumps of undissolved formula in the bottom of the bottle.  I am very disappointed because the price is right and it's one of only 2 options of organic formula that isn't full of arsenic.  Unfortunately a new shipment of 4 of these canisters arrived after realizing this, so we're stuck with it.  But I think I will mix it with another formula to minimize the spitting up."

Also, the cookie really gets stuck to your teeth, so don't forget a tootbrush if you're planning to eat these.<br /><br />The other flavour, Singoalla, is raspberry + vanilla, and doesn't melt.<br /><br />Personally, I recommend both.

This one tastes much different than other brands, it has a definate SWEET taste and tastes like the coconut taste Americans are familiar with from various coconut desserts or drinks.<br /><br />According to the label ""Our coconuts are harvested from the prized Nakorn Pathom province, where they grow larger and taste sweeter than from any other region in the world."" These are made from ""natural coconut water"" only, there are no added ingredients. This is a product of Thailand. It is distrubuted by a Taste Nirvana of Walnut California.<br /><br />Some people are curious about sodium content. The label says 42 mg of sodium per 9.46 fluid ounces. It has 50 calories and 600 mg of Potassium.<br /><br />There is a little pulp in this. It doesn't bother me but may be visually unappealing to some if they are used to a more clear looking coconut water.<br /><br />(I tried Vita Coco first which had a taste that I got used to after a while. I then tried Zico and decided I liked that ""flavor"" better than Vita Coco. Now I that I tried this, I like this Taste Nirvana water best of all.)<br /><br />What drew me to try Coconut water was the high potassium level (one serving is said to equal to two bananas), the electrolytes, and the fact that it is all natural. Coconut water is an excellent natural hydration beverage that does not have various negative things that the popular brand artificial drinks have in them.<br /><br />All coconut waters taste best when served very cold. The fact that this comes in a glass bottle makes it seem more chilled and it holds the chill longer than an aseptic pack or plastic bottle. They also package their product in aluminum cans although I have not tried that packaging."

I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement order free of charge. The second shipment was no better and I had to discard all the bottles. I wonder if Amazon is responsible for the poor packaging or if it is the vendor and whether or not it may be the heat during shipping that is causing all the seals to be broken.<br /><br />UPDATE: The manufacturer/company contacted me after this review and offered to send me a case of their dressing for my troubles.

Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often.

I knew something was amiss because I could smell the shampoo scent as if I had the opened bottle in my hand, when in fact it was still in the packaging.

It was a cremay mess, and i kept thinking by this being a creamy shampoo it will NOT rinse well, you see I wear Sisterlocks and my girlfriend traditional locs.<br /><br />BUT.....once I used the shampoo I was surprised. My girlfriend locs are much thicker than mine so I was concerned about the film and residue that would be left in her hair. So we washed her hair as usual 2 times, and rinsed. We didn't get that squeeky clean feel one would get with a clarifying shampoo but the shampoo rinses very well. Her hair was left with a soft, clean feel to it. Her locs didn't feel weighted down by the shampoo at all, however we noticed if you use too much you will get a feel of ""too much"". Just remember a dab will do it. Her scalp looked clean and her hair smelled fresh.<br /><br />The bottle says ""cleanese to remove product build-up and allow the scalp to breathe"" I believe this product did in fact do just that. THe moisture 10 system used includes shea butter, natural oils, including vitamin E, sunflower, coconut, almond, soybean, argan, and palm.<br /><br />Once you finish with your wash your hair is ready for the next phase adding the ""Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil"" fantastic 2 step process. You can just use the shampoo and not the hair oil if you don't need it.

I read through the reviews and felt this would do the trick until the regular stuff was available again.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the only thing the two seem to have in common is general shape and color. While the flavor isn't unpleasant, the texture leaves a lot to be desired. It's both fibrous and greasy, with globs/pockets of fat and strings of what I can only imagine to be muscle or gristle of some kind. They're like white threads, and the mouthfeel of the sliced product is very unappetizing.<br /><br />In reading through the reviews again, I saw one where the reviewer mentioned this summer sausage had potential when heated/cooked, so I sliced it thinly and tried both panfrying and microwaving it. This does improve the texture and allows the extra fat to render out (if you're microwaving, be sure to sit the pieces on top of paper towels, and don't let it go too long without checking ... LOTS of fat drains out of the meat!). After it's been heated/cooked, the product can be enjoyed for its flavor without the unpleasant texture.<br /><br />If our regular choice becomes unavailable again at some point, we'll just do without or look for something in a local grocery store. We won't be purchasing this product again."

379257,B001TM70XS,A27SRGWDTNMU48,A. Graham,4/4,5.0,1271894400,Best Kitty Food Money Can Buy!,"Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule. Anyway, the only flavor she goes absolutely nuts over is the Polynesian BBQ! She will go on hunger strikes if I don't have that flavor around. I don't know what they put in this flavor (crack? =)) to make Layla go nuts, but it's all she wants and now I'm forced to keep buying it.<br /><br />If you have a cat that has problems eating or is malnourished/anorexic (like Layla was), you would be hard-pressed to find food as high quality and apparently tasty as Weruva. My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I'm not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?<br /><br />Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother's chicken soup. They are similar in price to other ""luxury"" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior. You aren't losing anything, and you may end up with a very happy cat =).<br /><br />EDIT: Layla had to stop taking her methimazole due to side effects, and while we were working with her vet for other options, her stooling and over-urination (polyuria) have normalized. ! I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities. AND on a side note,  when I received Layla, her hair was like matted wire that fell out with just petting; now it is getting silky, and without those pesky oily parts (you know, behind the front legs?). She is really becoming quite beautiful."

You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.<br /><br />OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.<br /><br />I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.<br /><br />I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.  This guy is a whiz in the a.m.  I'm happy if I find the sink on the first try.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best pre-coffee coffee I've ever had.

I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index. Good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning."

Most red wines from kits benefit from some extra ageing (a few months), but this one was good from bottling day.<br /><br />When I got the kit, I decided to do something crazy with it.  In order to concentrate the flavor I decided to mix it only at four gallons instead of the instructions' suggestion of six gallons.  I had heard of others doing it to five gallons instead of six, and that was well-reviewed, but I hadn't heard of four gallons.<br /><br />The gravity was extremely high, about 1.120 if I recall correctly.  Since the kit comes with champagne yeast, though, I thought that they could handle it.  I oxygenated the fermenting wine three times in the primary, and believe me, it needed it!  The gravity took two weeks to drop down to 1.010, when I racked it out of the primary (bucket) fermentor to the secondary (carboy) fermentor.  It's still sitting in the secondary, waiting for the clarification steps.  It's going to be about 16% ABV, so it will no doubt benefit from ageing, but all-in-all I think it's going to resemble an ""auslese"" of a chianti when it's finished.<br /><br />Making the kit as instructed gives you thirty bottles (well, 28, really, after you lose a little from racking) of good table wine.  I've heard making it only five gallons will give you 25 bottles of improved wine, and I can confirm that making this kit to four gallons will give you 20 bottles of very strong, very tasty red wine."

More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest."

Hoyos,2/4,3.0,1339372800,The illy issimo Caff&egrave; Tastes Good if You Like Black Coffee,"I'm sleep deprived because I work two jobs and, therefore, drinking coffee is a matter of survival for me.  I drink iced coffee during the hot summer months.  I jumped at the opportunity to sample the illy issimo Caff&egrave;, which is Coca-Cola's attempt to make a profit from America's sudden craving for iced coffee.  Everyone from McDonald's to IHop is selling it.  Normally, I make my own iced coffee at Panera Bread.<br /><br />  The illy issimo Caff&egrave; looks and tastes like black, bitter coffee, which I detest.  See the photographs that I have posted showing how dark it is compared to other leading espresso coffee brands such as Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Cream (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005W48BQE"">Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso & Cream 6.5 oz x 8 Cans</a>) and Rockstar Roasted Coffee + Energy Mocha [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005GLRJ2K"">(Pack of 24) Rockstar Roasted Espresso Energy Drink 8 oz ea</a>].  Overall the illy issimo Caff&egrave; has less calories and fat per serving.  I posted photos depicting its nutritional value and ingredients.  However, the Starbucks tastes the best; naturally it has more fat and sugar.  On the other hand, the Rockstar gave me more energy, but it has a strange, sweet taste; the Rockstar is loaded with vitamins and minerals.  All three brands of coffee drinks are high in caffeine.<br /><br />  Starbucks doesn't have to worry about competition from Coca-Cola.  Starbucks exceptional taste, in lieu of nutritional benefits, will lure customers.  Most consumers drink iced coffee for its taste rather than its nutrition.  Furthermore, I don't understand why illy issimo Caff&egrave; has ""Do Not Shake"" on their cans.  No one else does.  I posted a photograph of a Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino Coffee Drink [<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS"">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; notice the ingredients that have settled at the bottom of the glass bottle.  I always shake my cans and bottles of coffee; the coffee may look frothy when I pour it but it has never spewed like carbonated sodas.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Caff&egrave; is only recommended for those who like their coffee black with a touch of sugar.  I believe it would be less expensive to make one's own coffee, refrigerate it until cool and then pour it over ice.  Rather than throw it away, I've brought home leftover coffee from my Sunday school class and put it in my refrigerator.  Later, when I ate dinner, I'd pour the coffee into a tall glass full of ice.  I'd add Stevia (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00430EJR8"">Sweetleaf Sweetener 70 Packets</a>) and milk until my sweet tooth was satisfied.  Speaking of Stevia, which is an all-natural sweetener with zero calories, I had to pour Stevia into my glass of illy issimo Caff&egrave; before I could finish drinking it.  I ran out of milk or I would have added some of that also.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos"

While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.

Of course that's all changed now, and coconut oil is recognized as one of the 'good' oils - but it was still only recently that I had a chance to try it for myself.  Wow!  It's great stuff.<br /><br />Coconut oil has a unique quality in that it has a melting point of 76 degrees, F - and out here where I live (Oregon), that means I seldom see it as a liquid oil (even in summer) - but that's fine with me, for one of the things I like using it for is in biscuits and pie crust, and for those, it has to be solid - and as a solid fat, coconut oil is quite hard (really hard!), even when close to 75 degrees - and for that reason, it is much better for use in baking, where a hard fat works much better than a soft one.<br /><br />But another characteristic of coconut oil that I love is its flavor and aroma - when you open the jar and stick your nose down in it, you are enveloped in the beauty of the coconut's best element, its aroma - its almost frightening how beautiful that smell is.  Maybe it's just me, but that aroma literally sends me to the tropics each time I open the jar.<br /><br />And then there's the flavor.  Most fats have little or no flavor - in fact, as cooks we've been taught to use a fat with no flavor in our cooking.  However, we all know that many fats are flavor!  And if we remove the fat, we lose much of the flavor.  Well friends, coconut oil is a fat with super flavor!  Anything you make with it will have the subtle flavor of the topics - I use it when I make rice, when I do S E Asian dishes and curries, and to make great scrambled eggs.  When you begin using it, coconut oil will open new doors of creativity in your cooking - and you will love it too."

It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.

Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing."

Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my oesophagus.<br /><br />And as a snob, I don't buy bagged teas, I buy loose leaf. So I normally wouldn't have drank this tea, except that I filched a couple of complimentary bags while waiting interminably at the local dealership (OK, I drank one at the dealership and stole 3, one for each hour I was kept waiting).<br /><br />On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.<br /><br />Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the tea bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.<br /><br />To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.<br /><br />Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste. Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much, because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it, I'll definitely buy some (because I think they have security cameras in the waiting area)."

These seem to always have a fairly good amount of chicken strips in them.  Try them at the store first, if you're going to just eat them with no hot sauce nor crackers.  They do have a fair amount of cheese sauce on them, but look at hamburger commercials - must be what the people want?<br /><br />The shelf life on these is maybe a year or more (vacuum sealed), so they can be used as survival food, I would think.

I'm not a hot sauce fanatic, and I don't even like overly spicy food, but this stuff is positively addictive. There is a sweet component to it, and a garlicky component that makes this more than just plain tabasco or hot sauce.<br /><br />I particularly like it on sliced avocado, scrambled egg or fried egg, and on stir fries, especially plainer ones with tofu and veg. It's also absolutely delectable on shrimp as a cocktail sauce mixed with ketchup, or on fish in general.  When we go out for Vietnamese pho (a broth with rice noodles, bean sprouts and various meats and garnishes) we squirt in a good lashing of this sauce to liven up the broth.<br /><br />I even saw a ""pyramid"" of food groups cartoon, with sriracha sauce squirted all over the pyramid, and I can only agree with the sentiment.

When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade.

My only quibble: they are rather pricey, and if they are not at their peak of freshness, they get hard, dry and brittle, though you can revive them somewhat by dunking them in milk or tea. In the store, you can tell the state of freshness by lightly pressing your thumb on the sample cookie through the cellophane. The cookie will yield slightly if it is fresh.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.

Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

Iams and, Eukanuba in particular, were a cut above other mass market dog food brands, and were only available through specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics. (Note, one can't compare their original foods with the quality of our present products, as premium all natural dog food, as we know it today, did not exist in the 1990s).<br /><br />Shortly after the acquisition, P&G expanded both Iams and Eukanuba to the mass market, making it widely available in supermarkets and retail stores such as Costco, K-Mart and Walmart, across the globe.<br /><br />Within months of the takeover, it became very apparent that changes had been made to the formulation of the foods. There were numerous accounts of dogs and cats suddenly developing various health issues and dog food allergies -- from diarrhea to intense itching, brittle and poor quality coats, skin rashes, hot spots, and even blown coats.<br /><br />The packaging remained unchanged, and no notification was given to retailers, pet owners or vets. (Note: Pet food companies are not required to list ingredient changes on dog food labels for 6 months -- a legal loophole for P&G).<br /><br />After much publicity and a huge public backlash, P&G admitted to switching ingredients from rice to barley, but denied making any other formula changes. They went as far as adding a PR page to their website in an attempt to dispel what they referred to as ""rumors"", and insisted they were continuing to use the same quality ingredients as before!<br /><br />In April 2000, P&G implemented another strategy in an attempt to further reassure the public of their ""emphatic commitment to maintaining the premium quality of Iams and Eukanuba dog and cat foods"" - and that - ""any product changes that occured were designed to enhance the product"". They convened an independent seven-member panel, known as the Iams Quality Review Board, consisting of veterinarians, breeders, research nutritionists and pet specialty store owners. The members met at the Company's Ohio plant to observe and review the manufacturing process and analyze and compare ingredients lists against product samples obtained over the past twelve months"

Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato.

I really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner. It makes drinking my daily intake of water easier.<br />The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go.

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011)."

In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't."

I can drink either blend but much prefer San Mateo because it clearly dried without smoke (they do not say whether the traditional blend is or not) and has a more ""refreshing"" flavor to my palate.  Long time drinkers of more traditional blends available in South America (Argentina, Uraguay, etc.) may not like it and may even find it bland or undrinkable, but from my limited experience with other types of yerba mate and my more ""American"" (United States) taste combined with the fact that I do not smoke (I have tried, but never liked it) I can barely stomach the more aged ""smoked"" or ""roasted"" types of mate.

It has a very mild flavor (I detected no bitterness myself) that may not have enough punch for some folks, but for an afternoon break it is perfect for me.<br /><br />I removed this coffee from the filter pods it comes in and filtered it myself in my own coffee drip pot.  I used two pods for sixteen ounces of coffee and it came out wonderful.  I actually enjoyed just sitting down on a lazy afternoon to watch the world fly by for a few minutes while drinking this coffee.  I know it sounds a bit strange, but the coffee actually relaxed and calmed me down.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee for folks who enjoy a quick break once in awhile.

374420,B00004CI84,A19JYLHD94K94D,Itamar Katz,2/2,5.0,1089244800,Remains one of my favorites,"Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor."

What I've started doing instead is inserting a small treat or two into the folds of the center.  This is much harder for her to get out and now this toy occupies her for hours.  It's a pretty durable material, but I'm sure it won't last forever.  I will happily buy another one, though, should it ever fall apart because she LOVES it so much now!  For instance, my dog usually flips out when we say the word ""potty"" (running laps around the house in excitement) because she knows she is going to get to go outside.  Well, when there is a treat in this thing, I practically have to pry it out of her mouth and hide it just so she will pay attention to the leash!  She almost carried it outside with her the first time I stuffed it with treats.  It's been a long time since I've seen my dog this happy with a toy and remain so content for so long.  Even when she shows interest in a toy initially, she usually gets bored with it rather quickly. Not this though!  I highly recommend this, even if you don't use it as intended!"

Not to mention he's itchy again! I didn't want to give up on it without a good trial, so I switched him to another high quality food for a bag (doing the proper transition, not to worry), and sure enough the dark tears lightened considerably.

She also developed urinary problems. My vet who is one of the few vets who have studied nutrition, tried calling Weruva to find out more specifics about their food including calories, because many of her feline patients were eating Weruva and gaining considerable weight. The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'. While I've read the positive reviews about this food and some obviously find their cats love it, if your cat is gaining weight or developing urinary problems while on Weruva, think twice about buying it."

The improvements compared to the previous DVD release are HUGE.  If I had to choose between warner spending money and time on a better transfer or more extra content, I would choose the better transfer.  After all, how many times are you going to watch behind the scenes material or a commentary?  It's been twenty years since this film was released, so it would be difficult for Tim Burton or anyone involved in the film to remember enough material for a commentary or even for short featurettes.  I'd rather have no commentary than a bad one.  This comes with a CD sampler of the soundtrack which is a nice addition.  I could care less about the episodes of the animated series even though I watched it as a kid.  My favorite aspect of this release is seeing the detail on the stop-motion puppets, the surreal set design, and Oscar winning makeup.  I can't recommend this enough."

I am a huge, yet disciminating, fan of hot suaces in general but this is by far my favorite right now.  I can handle a lot of heat as a regular hot sauce eater but this stuff is on a different scale than what you can get at the grocery store.  My husband won't come near this stuff.  It is so good I want to pour it on whatever I'm eating but it is sooooo hot I have to find that threshold of barely tolerable heat before it's so much I can't take it.  Of course, with continued dosage I can do more over time.  Our Publix and Kroger doesn't carry it so I have to go to the mercado/taqueria and can only get the 4 oz. version so this time I actually bought three 8 oz. bottles here on Amazon (fiendish, I know).<br /><br />The flavor is excellent, uncomplicated and straight forward like fresh green habaneros blended with a bit of salt and a bit of vinegar.  It isn't thin or overly vinegary or too salty though like a lot of hot sauces. I think this is because there is more actual habaneros in there because it's a little thicker consistency with a bit of fine texture to it.  Also, the color is fabulous.  I don't know if they add food dye or not but it is this vibrant, almost neon grass green.  Love it.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat it is on simple things like carne asada with flour tortillas, avocado and shredded lettuce, on 'over medium' fried eggs, and it's perfect on fish tacos with cool slaw, raw white onion and ranch.  The Mexican restaurant where I first had this doesn't have it on the tables anymore (probably because it's too hot for most) but they take it and puree it fine with avocado for this outrageously hot guacamole/habanero sauce thing that is just awesome.<br /><br />So obviously I love it and highly recommend it for experienced hot sauce people."

That and it has an equally nasty mediciney aftertaste.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I have not tried any of the other flavors (and I have heard that the Tangy Orange is better). But I do not plan to try them for a few reasons. One, the workers at my local vitamin store said they don't sell much Cyto Max. Two, my experience with the product (flavor aside) was that it didn't hydrate me any better than water, nor did I notice any significant improvement in energy, power, endurance, or recovery. Three, the label makes the dubious claim that it reduces soreness by reducing lactic acid (when science has known for quite some time that lactic acid has nothing whatsoever to do with muscle fatigue). And four, this stuff is 90 calories per serving, and you will likely drink more than one serving per workout. For those trying to burn fat, this means you will be getting your energy from the drink, rather than stored fat.<br /><br />I am still searching for a better tasting and lower calorie sports drink.

That's right, no compromise on taste! It is real pasta and it tastes like it should so this is an awesome product in the low carb world!! Try it, you'll love it.

The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.

Give me a minty mojito on a hot summer day (make sure you're not skimpy on that booze!) and I will be in heaven. No joke.<br /><br />I originally saw these Crystal Light Mocktails in my grocery store a month or two ago. While intrigued, I chose not to purchase this product due to my sensitivity towards artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose. Both tend to give me headaches and nausea, depending on the amount consumed. My reaction got so bad that I actually had to give up gum at one point (but I am a gum-aholic, so...). Lucky me food manufacturers put those things in EVERYTHING.<br /><br />But I digress. When I saw this was being offered to Vine members, I knew I had to give it a shot--sensitivity be damned.<br /><br />Two days ago, I received my Mojito Mocktail in the mail. I opened a package, poured it into a huge pitcher, and filled it with plenty of water. Upon taste testing, I was semi-impressed. Like another reviewer said, this was like a watered down lime drink. The mint is there, but it's not very strong. I knew it was missing something--and not the booze. Luckily, I had club soda in my fridge, so I poured half of a mini bottle into my glass. Instantly, my drink became a lot more appealing, and hence why the star rating is a 4.<br /><br />By itself, this mocktail is okay (probably 3 stars). With the addition of club soda, it becomes a lot tastier (4 stars).<br /><br />And while I know that this is supposed to be a mocktail, I cannot help but wonder if this would be good with some alcohol in it. I'd test it, but I got my nausea/headache from the aspartame and sucralose after a few hearty gulps which means no more for me.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Only if you do not have an artificial sugar sensitivity. My family seems to enjoy it though, so while I might not purchase this for myself, I probably would for them... or someone who does not drink alcohol, but enjoys the taste of mojitos."

When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards."

I have no idea what's 'kind' about it, and I don't like the push for grains to be considered 'required' in anyone's diet. The original studies that showed fiber was important for digestion were all studies on VEGETABLE fibers in real whole foods, not in processed grains.

They've given us some and I'll admit, it was pretty good.  Then we brought home Mexican ""traditional"" blended vanilla from a vacation to the Yucatan. We fell in love with it and started baking significantly more than we ever have in the past!  We started looking exclusively for recipes that included vanilla, and the more the better.  Since that first purchase we always came home from dive trips to Cozumel and the Yucatan with bottles of the stuff to use and give to family and friends.  The vanilla flavor of the vanilla/vanillin blend is superb and oh-so-vanilla-satisfying in everything you bake.<br /><br />We haven't made it back to Mexico in three years or so and recently ran out of our previous stock of traditional blend.  We used the higher alcohol Tahitian pure vanilla for baking recently but the flavor is noticeably different.  With no Mexican trips on the schedule we thought we'd give Molina Mexican Vanilla Blend a try from Amazon.  It arrived, we opened it, and it is absolutely the vanilla/vanillin blend we love.  As I type we have a Ricotta Mascarpone vanilla custard baking in the oven and the aroma of vanilla filling the house is wonderful.<br /><br />I understand that many folks only use pure vanilla.  That's great.  But if ""pure"" isn't that important to you and you just want incredible vanilla flavor, give Molina Mexican Vanilla Blend a try."

DO NOT buy Superior's brand of instant decaf, even tho i prefer weaker coffee i had to use 4 of their individual packets to get even a slightly mild flavor, it was much cheaper than tasters choice and as we learn over and over again 'you get what you paid for'... so now i'm back ordering the good stuff."

I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it."

I never liked cherry flavored candies (I prefer fresh cherries). Apricot just tastes very bland. At first, since I've never had a fruit leather, it was very hard and less sugary than the usual fruit snacks I've always had.

My aging cat needs a constant source of water so this took the pain out of constantly changing the water. The fountain arrived quickly and assembly wasnt painfull (I do have an engineering degree so my apologies to those who disagree). I love this cat fountain. It runs quitely and after some initial apprehension (well it isnt THAT quiet), my old cat has been using it and seems to have no problem with it. I did have to place her food next to the fountain to get her to come near the fountain. The reason I didnt give it 5 stars are beacause when pouring water in, when it begins to reach the top it has the tendency to overflow onto the floor. It has a floating indicator that tells you when its getting full but I would like a little more tolerance. The other issue is that the filter needs replacing and that means a constant expense and dependency on their products. Small sacrifices for the peace of mind that my cat always has water. Also, the water does evaporate at a rate of about 4 cups per week so you will be refilling."

One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:<br /><br />Product Description<br />Every refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light ""Natural"" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />""Natural"" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, ""natural"" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does ""taste"" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah, I know, I don't ""have"" to buy it.  They don't ""have"" to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.)"

Store bought milk just stayed in the refrigerator until it was time to be tossed.  I think this was because when I opened the cap, the scent was overwhelming and the taste was just milk. Dry milk in the stores looked unsightly with cheap packaging.  You could see several bags already torn and powder leaking from the bag and onto the shelf. The stores are not pushing powder milk sales.<br /><br />Since I started using dry milk, I found out that I was in control of the amount of water and powder I wanted to use.  I have used more milk in the last few months that I have used in the last 40 years.  My husband and I love it.  No waste and always fresh looking and smelling. Best of all, it is a good source of protein.<br /><br />The Now Foods Non Fat Dry milk powder is easy to use: one cup powder and 4 cups water to make a quart.  I use a four quart cooking pot, pour 2 cups water then 1/2 cup powder and let it settle.  Then 2 cups water and the rest of the powder.  I use a whisk because I don't like using a mixer. I check the whisk frequently for milk clumps.  When done, I let the solution stand for a couple of minutes to let the bubbles settle and then pour the solution into a BPA free container and place it in the refrig.  Don't worry about extra air bubbles as they will disappear when the milk container is cold. Easy and fast cleanup.<br /><br />With gas prices clinbing up, milk prices will rise too.  Don't worry about shortages as you have a supply of milk powder and fresh water to make great tasting milk.  I will never go back to fresh milk."

She is finicky and even worse, has a delicate stomach condition. Not only do we get the usual hairballs, but I've had to clean up after her about three times a day.<br /><br />As a result, we're very careful in how we feed her. In terms of dry food, we've given her IAMS and Science Diet. After a brief honeymoon period, she wouldn't touch the stuff (Science was very expensive, so I learned my lesson there, pricey doesn't mean Lily will like it). In terms of wet foods, she likes Fancy Feast Classic but never manages to finish a can. There's always leftover meat in her bowl.<br /><br />Then I gave her Nature's Variety. The first time I served it, she lapped it up. In fact, she licked her bowl clean, not a speck of food left! I was also surprised to see tiny bits of an orange-colored vegetable in her food (carrot?). Since I'm a bit of a vegetarian myself, I highly approve of the 5% veggies that come in this type of canned food. I'm also glad that this grain-free food is a pate, which makes it perfect for older cats like Lily.<br /><br />She's been eating this non-stop for about two weeks now (still licking the bowl clean!) and so far so good(fingers crossed). Fancy Feast seemed to be the only type of food she liked, so I'm happy to be able to add this to the list."

Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours."

I'm not sure what the ""taste"" was, as the ingredients in the mix are the same ingredients I use in my own recipes, but there was definately something off.  I notice another reviewer called it a ""chemical"" taste.  Whatever it was, no one will eat the cookies- even though I put a ton of dark chocolate and peppermint chips in them.

Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).

539363,B001BDDT8K,ASPOWEJIPMYYW,"D. Lamb ""avid reader""",3/3,5.0,1262995200,made my kitties into addicts,"We have three cats. The two older ones are huge, 10-year-old DSH males, litter mates, who have been separated about 5 days their entire lives and have had just about the best of everything all along. The third is a 5-year-old Siamese male who adopted us as a tiny kitten; he was malnourished and his physical condition showed it when he came to my back porch 4.5 years ago.<br /><br />All are at healthy weights and are active. The big cats are not obese - they're just large cats. I always have dry IAMS available as kibble 24/7, and I give them each a portion of canned food a couple of times a day; they do not ask for food unless they are hungry. The older cats don't like poultry or beef (read: loudly whine for seafood when presented with chicken, in stunned disbelief that I'm not running a restaurant after the 5,391 times they've already complained). The Siamese isn't as picky because he was a stray until he found us. Mushy, gooey loaf? Won't eat it at all. Texture is important.<br /><br />I had not heard of this brand before I saw it here on Amazon.com and I have not seen it locally. Since my little monsters enjoy food, like this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010B6IFY"">Fancy Feast Gourmet Cat Food Grilled 3-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>,  I thought I'd try the 'Subscribe & Save' option for a couple of months to see if they like Petite Cuisine too.<br /><br />Verdict: they're absolutely nuts about it. We call it 'kitty crack' - if there was a rehab or 12-step program for addicted cats, I'd have to send all three of mine for treatment. They can't get enough of it.<br /><br />This is definitely not fish 'flavored' food. The cans are chock full of fish, with tiny shrimp, flaky red snapper, tuna, and whitefish. It smells like fish but it doesn't have a fishy or stale odor. The cans open easily and not much sticks to the bottom and sides of the can - I can just dump food into a bowl without using a utensil to get the last bits out. The aroma and appearance are so good that _I'd_ eat it if I had to do so.<br /><br />I have read and noted concerns about menadione. However, high doses mentioned in some studies aren't equivalent to the small amount contained per portion in this food. To me, the benefits outweigh the risks. Best of all, my Siamese has developed a shiny, thick, ultra-soft coat which he did not have before he started eating this food. He's almost as soft as a chinchilla.<br /><br />In short: looks great, smells great, and I have happy, happy cats. A winner. :-)"

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

I've had many cups of Matcha & Sencha but never together. That combination is a synergystic blend if there ever was one. The sencha/matcha combo is grassy and sweet at the same time. After a steep of 1 minute the tea turned a nice translucent emerald green color. It was also suggested to tap the empty foil wrapper over your cup to sprinkle the remaining matcha residue into your cup. The tea is invigorating, vegetal, grassy and slightly sweet.<br />I rate this amongst the best I have tried. Ito En is a well known Japanese company. I previously tried their bottled line of iced teas and the unsweetened green tea with mint was so very very good. It's worth buying this premium tea online.

But combined with mushrooms or DMT it will give an intense trip.

I prefer these over bully sticks or rawhides because they do not cause any tummy upset or difficulties with the pups' stool.

The male immediately took to it so his sister had to give it a try. Now she loves them as much as he does. They will sit or down or just about anything to get their antler.

It's very similar, but a much smaller grain. We cooked it basically the same way. The appearance on the plate was very pretty - reminded me of caviar. I really enjoyed the lightly nutty flavor. The texture, because of the small grains, is a bit grainy or sandy. I didn't mind it, but some people don't like unusually-textured foods. It's possible that the texture would be less distinct, had we cooked it longer - quinoa, I know, has a very different texture if you cook it al dente or let it go till the grains puff out.

To start - it's large enough for an overstuffed sandwich.  I love the crinkle sound of the bag, it holds a crease at the top.  It is going to make the same old sandwiches seem to take on a new life with this new bag - nostalgic. It will be good to put muffins I bake in the 'donut hole maker' into this for quick grab snacks.  This won't cause any moisture mushiness like a plastic wrap will.  No waxy feel - all biodegradable.  I like it.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept 13: I've been using these bags since they arrived...they are wonderful.  My brother gives them 5 stars.  I make him 2 sandwiches a day, one for breakfast and one for lunch.  When he returns home, I notice he carefully folds the bags up for me to reuse.  I can use the same 2 bags, every day, for a week without a problem.  They are sturdy and hold up well.  Even with crinkles in the paper, they still hold a good crease.  I make the sandwiches the night before and they don't dry out nor become soggy in the fridge over-night or until his last sandwich at lunch.  I notice when I use plastic wrap or foil he throws those away...these bags are nicely folded and brought back home, so I guess they are a money-saver in the long run.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 22, 2012:  It's been a year since first trying these bags.  I've upped the stars from 4 to 5 stars.  I absolutely love this product.  It's come in handy for so many things.  It works almost like parchment paper, too.  I've baked in these for wrapped meals, knowing it is all safe against foods.  Tomorrow I'm trying large diced potatoes, cheese and bacon put into the bag - pop into an oven and bake about 45 minutes at 350, top with fresh green onions (scallions).  So many uses for these bags.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 23, 2012: Do not use these as a substitute for parchment paper.  When I cooked the potatoes in the bag with cheese and bacon - the cheese stuck!  I think it would have been okay had I not used cheese.  I invested in their parchment paper: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZIC8I"">If You Care 100% Unbleached Silicone Parchment Paper, 70-Foot Roll (Pack of 4)</a> and will use this either alone or added into the sandwich bags when I bake with them.  The sandwich bags did hold up well in a 425 degree toaster oven.<br /><br />**I LOVE their paper cupcake liners.  I have the large and Jumbo. (large equals a standard sized muffin cup)  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR96"">If You Care Unbleached Large Baking Cups, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>  NOTHING sticks to these at all.  Your baking cup paper will peel right off of your cupcakes and muffins with ease, never tearing at even the most delicate cakes. I give a box for a little gift when visiting.  These are the best and with the initial investment you won't be buying them for a long time.  The brown paper is excellent for us adults who are tired of fake inks and cutesy flowers...the color is very becoming and stays the same before and after the oven.  I love the ""If You Care"" brand."

This long and careful procedure creates a mix of phenolic compounds, including a natural form of glutamic acid, that contributes to the unique taste and aroma of traditionally brewed soy sauce.  The modern bioreactor method produces a product by rapid hydrolysis, rather than by complete fermentation, in the space of two days and uses glutamase as a reactor, so that the final product contains large amounts of the UNNATURAL glutamic acid that is found in MSG.

They taste somewhat like plastic, and the ""cherry flavor"" is worse than the worst tasting cough medicine you can think of. These don't taste ANYTHING like fruit. These are supposed to be cherry flavored, but the word cherry appears no where in the ingredients (apple puree concentrate is the only fruit item listed), and the word ""fruit"" doesn't appear anywhere at all. They also pull that bait-and-switch telling you 70 calories per serving, but there's 2.5 servings in these dinky little 2.5oz bags. These are disgusting. It's been 60 minutes and I still can't get this taste out of my mouth. Next time I want something fruit flavored, I'll just eat a piece of fruit.

I actually paid more for the shipping than I did for the 2 bottles of sauce.  I did not receive my packagae until 9 days later but I was shorted a bottle.  I wrote to the company and told them of this.  They agreed to sending me another bottle free of shipping.  Mind you, this is a $5 bottle of sauce.  Three days later I receive an email stating that they reviewed their camera recording and it was clear that there was 2 bottles shipped together and that the weight of the package was correct for the amount shipped.  So they insinuated I had lied to them.  I am not sure what happened on their end, but there was only 1 bottle of sauce in my package.  Not sure why someone would lie over a $5 bottle of sauce so they could get it for free.  It is a shame because granted, the sauce is hot but good, and they would have received several orders from some from friends, but knowing what the company has accused me of can guarantee no other orders will be placed.  Word of mouth is a company's advertisement, and it is unfortunate this company will not be getting any positive feedback from me.  I have never been accused of lieing and take great insult over it that this company would do so.  You can be assured I will be ordering from some other company in hopes that the shipping rate is equal to the time paid for, and where the company sends the correct amount ordered.

Well Kellogg's is trying to remedy that issue by creating this sweet cereal that is somewhat healthy.<br /><br />TASTE: I love cinnamon and really enjoyed the taste of this cereal.  While you won't mistake it for a Cinnabon, it has a nice sweet flavor to it.  The whole grain does not detract from the taste.<br /><br />NUTRITION: The serving size is 47 mini-biscuits.  This gives you 190 calories (10 from fat), 12 grams of sugar, and 6 grams of fiber.  The sugar content is actually lower than you'll see in a lot of sugary cereals.  And the real star is the 6 grams of fiber.  This is a nice bonus as most people do not eat enough fiber in a day.  This cereal is considered an ""excellent source"" of fiber and is also made from 100% whole grain.<br /><br />Overall, I find these mini-wheats to be a solid combination of taste and nutrition."

Biryani is one of my favorite dishes, so when I saw this product I had to try it.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Kitchens of India products is that fact that the ingredients list is all natural, and you can identify every single thing on the list. I'm not someone who eats solely natural or organic products, but I do appreciate it when I am able to do so.<br /><br />The taste of the resulting Biryani you will create using these packets is absolutely outstanding; considering how simple the recipe becomes using this paste, the taste to effort ratio is incredible. I won't lie and say I've never had a better Biryani in a restaurant or homemade by my wife's grandmother, but I can't imagine another product being this easy to use and still tasting anywhere close to as good. The only thing I would warn is that if you follow the exact instructions on the packet, your biryani will be HOT. This is coming from two people who can handle a decent amount of spice, if you use the entire paste packet in your recipe, the resulting outcome is almost unbearably hot to eat.<br /><br />Not a problem though, as there are two very easy options. You can either use HALF (yes, you really will need to cut it down by 50%) of the paste in each packet, mixed with the recommended amount of meat. Or, you can use the whole packet, and just double the amount of meat, and the result is perfect as well. We prefer the latter, as both of us are always left wanting to eat leftovers again the next day!<br /><br />So if you are looking for a great, simple way to make homemade Indian food that is quick enough even for weeknight meals, you will love this Biryani paste (and probably lots of other Kitchens of India products). Just be warned, if you use the whole thing, it will be SPICY."

A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant. If cinnamon can help control the level of blood sugar and, by offshoot, fat levels, then that is corroboration of what some have said regarding its weight loss potential."

Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!"

He liked it and had no health problems from eating it, except one which didn't bother him much, but made life hell for myself & my wife. While eating this food, the puppy would release huge, terribly smelling dog farts. He did this with alarming regularity, every 20-30 minutes my wife & I would look at each other, sniff the air, then promptly evacuate the room to escape an invisible cloud of deadly (DEADLY!) gas wafting over from the dog's direction.<br /><br />The puppy, being a dog, would usually follow us to wherever we ended up, only to administer another dose of the stench 30 minutes later. And so went the round robin, with all 3 of us changing the room we occupied twice an hour.<br /><br />We endured 3 weeks of this before switching to Wellness dry kibble which made the farting problem go away. The Wellness food is slightly worse as far as ingredient quality goes, but it's still very good so we're ok with using it.<br /><br />I'm still rating Orijen puppy food at 4 stars based on the ingredients, which are excellent. While on it, other than farting, the dog was happy and looked great, no problems with stool or health. So I'm not saying that this food is bad - in fact, I think it's one of the better ones out there. I am saying that every dog is different (surprise, surprise!) and that if you do decide to buy Orijen, start with the smallest bag to determine it works for you before committing to a bigger one. I now have about 13lbs of Orijen dog food left and no idea what to do with it.<br /><br />Actually, now that I write this, I know what to do with it. I'll ask a friend to watch my dog at their home for a few days next time we go on vacation, and provide him with Orijen puppy food. Then ask him how things went. Cruel, I know, but oh so funny!"

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness."

That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."

It is a truly ""dark"" chocolate that is not bitter and thus perhaps too sweet for some who are looking for a bar with a higher cocoa percentage.  This melts great and has a very smooth texture.  I like it especially because I can place a square between my cheek and gum and it will slowly melt giving me lots of chocolate flavor.  I have been having trouble finding it in stores because, I presume, tastes are shifting to a higher cocoa content.  I am happy to be able to find it online.  I suggest not buying a case in the summer as it could be damaged sitting in a hot truck awaiting delivery."

We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.

San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser did not disappoint (haven't tried the French Roast yet). Fog Chaser is a moderatly bold coffee, smooth, with no hint of bitterness. As for the skeptics concerned with the ""netted"" base of the cup affecting taste and freshness...the product is packaged in mini packs ( sealed thick plastic) of 8 cups to protect freshness. In addition, I feel the netting (not flimsy by any means) offers a better fitration system that the typical K cup. I only write reviews about products that excite me, or repulse me.

I have, however, figured out what to do with the candy, I will make nice little boxes and cones in bright colour and make presents of the ones I don't particularly like. I would say only 2-3 of the bags wasn't to my liking, the rest is just as yummy as I had hoped for.<br /><br />I really like the real taste of the candy. There is no artificial flavour, it's all got clean real taste. I loved the mint ones, and of course the strawberries (I ordered a big bag of those... I will have candy for years!), did not care so much for the spicey ones, nor the root beer one. But that's just me, I think, I don't drink root beer either :)<br /><br />I am glad I got these, though, it's always nice to have some candy in a bowl for visitors, and the fact that the taste is real, and no artificial anything in them, makes me very happy.

This cake flour is also made from soft winter wheat which sounds like a gimmick of some kind but it makes a difference in cakes.  The main differences between this and all purpose are that it is finer and contains much less gluten which is great for breads but makes cakes doughy especially if over mixed.  I will sometime use this flour if I want to lighten up one of my existing recipes by replacing 1/2 or 1/3 of the AP flour like if I want a more fluffy Madeline but still have a good crumb.  This flour is definitely not for bread as it lacks the gluten required but it is great for a perfect cakes (I used it in my three tier wedding cake).  Also note that this is not self rising but I prefer that as I can control the amount of leavening agent and salt.  This stuff is awesome for light and airy southern style biscuits ( I can't believe I ever used all purpose).  The flour comes sealed in a bag inside the box which seems to hold the approx 8 cups that I get out of each and although it pre sifted i always sift again for good measure.  Happy Baking!

I have a friend who comes over for an afternoon visit, and we sit outside on the patio sipping the real thing.  Well, that is not always wise considering the calorie intake, so I was intrigued by the Crystal Light Margarita mix.  After mixing up a batch of the unusual murky-green colored fluid, we tried it.  It's not as good as the real thing, but we figured that it wouldn't be, anyway!  We were actually surprised that the taste was close, maybe a little too salty.<br />My friend loves the Crystal Light Lemonade so she did not have a big problem with the taste.  I don't usually drink the ""fake"" stuff (have my own lemon tree)so I was a bit distracted by the aftertaste caused by the Aspartame sweetener.  But, because I'm diagnosed pre-diabetic, I am trying to stay away from sugars, so I am willing to give the Margarita Mix a second chance.  Maybe in the near future Kraft will consider trying any of the ""other sweeteners"" in their Crystal Light products?  Let's hope."

It is a resinous (piney) aromatic bitter-sweet spice, rather intense. The green papery pods are broken open, and the dark seeds inside can be pulled out and ground in a mortar for use in breads, cookies, curries, puddings, chai and the like. It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes. <p>If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg. The pods are a nuisance to process, but the volatile essential oils are so fugitive that it's better to put up with the job of extracting the seeds than to use ground cardamom that will just lose its scent.

It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are ""100 Calorie Packs"", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight.

227159,B000SARJM4,A2S60091KO5VYX,Mark Phillips,3/3,4.0,1305072000,Average green tea,"I must preface this review with one thing: Taste is subjective. I believe reviews for edible or imbibe-able products on amazon should always be taken with a grain of salt. Having gotten that out of the way, let me also say that I believe this tea deserves more in the way of a 3.5 or 3.7. The price per pound is very good for the quality of tea. After having drank this tea for a couple of months, I must admit that I am quite tired of the taste.<br /><br /> - My typical experience with this tea has been to brew a large pot, to fill my 24 ounce vacuum thermos, and to bring it to the library for long hours of studying. It suffices well for this. Due to the large quantity, I never have any issue making too much as I can just pour it out with little harm.<br /><br /> - It is very easy to over brew this tea. For the first two weeks I did this constantly; the tea is awful when overbrewed. Take care with the quantity of tea and length of steep. Better to under steep than over steep.<br /><br /> - There is a very fine powder along with the rest of the tea. Be sure to use a decanter with a fine weave or simply shake whichever decanter you use with the tea in it to get as much of the powder out as possible.<br /><br /> - The taste, when brewed correctly, is good. The lemon comes through and adds a nice olfactory touch to the experience.<br /><br />All in all, a good product, and recommended for green tea lovers. Do not judge the tea off of the first brew, like I did, but fiddle around with the quantity of tea brewed and the time steeped until you decide whether or not you enjoy this product."

The food industry uses words like these because they don't want you to know the truth about the unhealthy ingredients in the food, as they would get less buyers. I know I wouldn't have bought this if I knew. This is where I read about it:  [...]<br />(Get rid of the spaces to paste in browser)<br /><br />Besides this, I really think it is a delicious and comforting flavor, which is why I have bought this many times... it is too bad I can't conscientiously get it again knowing about this ""natural flavors"" labeling scam.<br /><br />However it is fair to say that this is sort of the lesser evil as far as instant soups go.

I went away for a few months when they kinda needed to be used up, and the ones that I had left dried out.  Should've stored them better.  Oh, well, now I have a way to make homemade vanilla extract.  I've had a couple soaking in a canning jar filled with vodka for about a month, so I'll bet I have some really nice homemade vanilla extract now.

If you like freshly ground spices this is the way to go.  Allspice, Pepper, Cloves, Cinnamon are just a few of the spices that I use with this mortar and pestle.  When it comes to garlic and onion I use a pharmacist's glass mortar and pestle.  The reason is that marble is a porous substance and there can be a flavor carry over from one use to the next. I also use a porcelain mortar and pestle, but they are more fragile.<br /><br />To clean, wipe with a damp cloth, that works to a certain extent, but I found that using glycerin U.S.P. (anhydrous) to clean the marble works better and it helps seal the marble and clean away the residue (essential oils) of the spices better.  Now, you used to be able to buy this at the pharmacy, but since all of this terrorism scare you can't find it over-the-counter and have to ask for it or you can order it from Amazon.  It only takes about 2 ml (one-half teaspoonful) to clean the mortar and pestle. After the cleaning with glycerin, I use a damp cloth to clean further. Among other uses glycerin is used for chafed, chapped, and cracked lips and windburned skin. So, it is safe to use, it is used as a sweetening agent, and makes the marble less porous and look better. Dimensions: 3-1/4"" diameter x 3"" tall bowl, 4"" pestle.<br /><br />I am pleased with this little kitchen aid and the aroma from the freshly ground spices it absolutely amazing and you can grind to the consistency that you need and you aren't beholden to what the manufacturers of spices believe to be the correct consistency.

For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether."

This is a good product and if you have one of those single cup brewers, then this will be even better.<br /><br />The only downside is that if they had some good instructions on how to brew a single cup included they would most likely have higher sales. The roast is really full flavored and delicious."

Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality. It's worth the upgrade if you like Beetlejuice as much as I do."

151560,B004XE0MCK,A2I60HCAVEF3RC,Tiger,0/0,5.0,1323216000,Top of the Line K-Cup,"I really love this k-cup.  It is my second favorite regular coffee K-cup (at this time), second only to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW"">Barista Prima House Blend</a>.  I agree with their text that states a more complex flavor.  The claim is that this is a premium line for those who expect a premium coffee more like a coffee shop.  I tend to agree, except you just don't get as much per cup.  I love the colombian blend flavor as variety to mix in between the house blend, which I absolutely love most.  The house blend is a very blended flavor without one note overpowering the others.  For a change, I like the stronger note that the colombia blend offers.  Both match my preference for medium or medium-dark house blend roasts from coffee shops, but not the very dark roast of Starbucks.  I really feel this is a complex blend that has well more than one note, but a slightly stronger note associate with colombia blends.  Most importantly, it doesn't taste burnt like a dark french roast.<br /><br />I have tried so many K-cup flavors, most of which I liked at varied degrees with a few exceptions, but this one is currently my second favorite (second to the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLILAW"">Barista Prima House Blend</a> in the same variety).  What is nice about K-cups is you can easy switch blends per cup or over time without having to exhaust a whole bag of beans or grounds before moving on.  And preferences change as you have the same day in and day out.  So I can say that at present, I love it over previous favorites (of non-flavored) which in descending order of current preference are: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXHGPK"">Wolfgang Puck Chef's Reserve Colombian</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC"">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Dark Magic</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IO37Y"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1GFN2"">Caribou</a>, and a number of other decent ones.  I am just saying I prefer this over those right now.  But I will still have the others for variety.  Within this variety, I really like the house blend best.  But I prefer variety and usually have House Blend in the morning, and a Colombia blend in the afternoon.  On more rare occasions, I'll have the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K"">Barista Prima Italian Roast</a> when I feel like a dark french roast with very strong flavor.<br /><br />The Barista Prima tends to be more expensive, and depending on the sale price, can be only a little more expensive than other varieties.  For a little bit more, it is worth it to me.  For a lot more, maybe not.  Paying about 12% more yields about 30% more in value in flavor to me.  But paying 50% more is costly when there other flavors are plenty good too."

With milk and sugar, though, the black tea just did not have the strength needed to counter-balance the spice medley.  Things improved when I added a second bag to the cup, but overall it was just too bitter and again, the BODY that you expect the black tea to provide just wasn't there.  With a different or stronger tea base Stash could have a real winner here, because they certainly have the spice blend right on."

It even impressed some wannabe wine snobs.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended.  These kits are no brainers, and with the price and free shipping the wine is about $1.75 per bottle and is comparable to an $8-$12 wine, IMO.  This is my second kit from this supplier and I am nothing but happy.  Nice to have a good bottle of wine with dinner and not have to cringe at spending $10 each night.  Besides, it's easy and fun.

It takes about 30 seconds so you can easily make another cup. I also like the variety of pods they offer. My favorite is the Kenya blend. The Dark Roast is good when I want a more robust flavor. What I don't like about the Senseo pods is that the individual pods are not labeled with the name of the blend. I would like to put all of my different senseo pods into the same airtight jar for display but I can't do this because I would not know which pod was which blend--they all look the same. So in order to know which pod is which blend, I must keep all the pods in their original packages and since the packages do not seal once opened, the pods can go stale. I suppose I could keep all my opened Senseo packages in a large tupperware container but that is such a hassle and so unattractive."

But, it wasn't until I bought a steam mop (here on Amazon) and tackled my vinyl kitchen floors, that hadn't been well cleaned in years... that I discovered the MAGIC of vinegar. This steam mop left my floor so tacky and sticky, if I stood in one place, I felt like either the floor or my skin was going to come off. I took to the internet for a solution. Someone said to mop the floor with vinegar. Skeptical, but desperate, I did ONE mopping of the vinegar all over the kitchen floor. Just like that, as soon as it dried my floor was clean again. Extremely excited, I looked up more magic ways vinegar cleans. Then I ran out of vinegar, and had to buy some more. I have used it now to clean faux wood blinds that had grease & dust buildup, air return vent that had years of residue & dust build up, and stained toilets.

Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"

This is a paraphrase but substantially what he said. ""I know you have been making spaghetti sauce for me for thirty years and this can't possibly be the best, but it sure tastes like it."" I had been concerned that it would taste more like pizza than spaghetti but it did not. I can't speak to how this sauce would taste over pasta without the amendments I made, but as a base it works beautifully.

One of the dishes was macaroni and cheese, normally simple fare. My son loves mac and cheese, so I decided to try this recipe. One problem: It called for drizzling the final product with truffle oil. This was not something in my pantry.<br /><br />So, I checked out Amazon reviews of various Truffle Oil products. Most at some reasonable price feature olive oil, infused with a bit of truffle oil. Many of the products were negatively evaluated by reviewers. This tended to be responded to fairly positively. So, I took a shot and ordered a small bottle (3.5 ounces).<br /><br />And, boy, did it work out. It added a real richness to the final product. As a result, I am now more intrigued at the prospect of using truffle oil on recipes that might benefit (I just had a delightful dinner at Capital Grille, where French Fries were topped with parmesan cheese and truffle oil--quite tasty!).<br /><br />So, despite the reality that this is olive oil infused with truffle oil, it works well enough for me. . . ."

I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking. Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com! Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product ""meltage"" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R92"">5 LBS. Merckens White Coatings</a> and Blue (1 lb.) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00085F7S2"">1LB. Merckens Blue Coatings</a> Candy Coating. To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker! A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R9W"">1LB. Merckens Yellow Coatings</a> and Paramount crystals <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012A2FVY"">Paramont Crystals, 1 lb.</a>  , along with a couple other items. This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it ""fowl'?). I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say ""It's as hot as Corn Liquor!"" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note those of you who remove stars based on issues irrelevant to the item itself, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based things that don't speak to the product...such as shipping speed, poor customer service or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the ""back-story"" out of the way...the actual review! I set about making chocolate cake balls to make a r/w/b flag and some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain, to put on a stick, coated and decorated with sprinkles. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular ""dip-fest"" as it were. Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest method...I melted some white almond bark (I'd used almond bark in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts. Of the 4, the Mercken's was the ""winner"" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste. I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it ""setting up"" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary. The Almond Bark was the least expensive, slightly more difficult to work with for this project, not real white, very yummy. Mercken's is available in many colors, is readily available (in Dallas), is less $ than Mercken's and certainly the Ghirardelli, but not quite a smooth and a tad more difficult to work with.<br /><br />Also, I was a tad skeptical that the Mercken's Super White Coatings would be so ""super white"", because the actual wafer didn't look too white to me.  To my surprise, I was pleased with how white it ended up once melted. I posted a photo of my cake ball flag, using the white and blue candy melts.  The red balls were made with the white melts with Wilton's Red Candy Food Coloring <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FWVX"">Wilton Primary Candy Color Set</a>. Hopefully, you can get an idea of the color and coverage. Of course, each computer monitor may show color differently.<br /><br />If you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's . If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's are head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was/is the biggest factor in my preference. With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts I was serving were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.<br /><br />***Note, I have pretty much the exact same review for the 5 lb. white, 1 lb. blue and 1 lb. yellow Mercken's Coatings, thanks to ""Cut and Paste"", to spare myself the trouble of re-writing the same review. Therefore, there is need to read my reviews for those items."

All of my cats but one developed loose stools on this cat food. It took me several bags of cat food to figure out that it was this cat food that was causing the problem because it did not kick in right off the bat. I had been mixing this with their old dry food and I was supplementing with canned food during the transition, so it took a bit to narrow down this new food as the source. The smaller cats developed the diarrhea before the larger cats did. I believe there is just a bit too much fiber in this formulation or perhaps it is the berries in the ingredients that trigger the loose stools. I would not have a problem mixing this with Iams or Science Diet if I could figure out the threshold where the loose stools starts. For now, I'm just going to stick to supplementing with canned food, which has almost no filler in it. On a final note, the cats were not thrilled with this.

Then the energy levels went up even higher & this did not upset her sensitive stomach.

Let me tell you, this stuff is very versatile! I know Nestle just advertises it as a chocolate milk drink mix, but we've found many uses for it.<br /><br />I use it with milk to make hot cocoas (and it's become my preference over Swiss Miss packets and the like), we've used it to add chocolaty flavors to baking projects, we obviously make our toddler the occasional chocolate milk for a treat, but my favorite thing to do with Nesquik powder is to make myself an iced mocha! (Although you could certainly make hot mochas as well). My husband has recently been on my case for spending almost $5 every day (sometimes twice) on Starbuck's iced mochas. I have a newborn, you see, so I'm sleep deprived and my coffee consumption has gone up. I'm addicted! But we realized the Starbuck's charges were adding up quite a bit, so as an alternative, most days I turn to Nesquik instead. It doesn't taste like Starbuck's mochas, but it does make for a tasty coffee drink if you like them chocolaty. I use one shot of espresso (or strong coffee if I'm away from our espresso machine), two spoonfuls of Nesquik, and fill the glass up the rest of the way with about 1 cup of milk. It's yummy! You can add ice, or keep it hot if you like. In the long run, we've saved money for sure by using the Nesquik.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that as a mom, the ingredient list is satisfactory. This obviously isn't what you'd call health food, and certainly not advertised as organic or anything - but as far as the ingredient list goes it's pretty mild. No scary sounding ingredients I can't pronounce on the label - mostly minerals, vitamins, and sugar. There are no artificial sweeteners, as advertised.

One bag per gallon is perfect for us. I know there are those out there who want it stronger and tarter, but I have two reasons. One, it saves money by using less and honestly, if I let it steep for a long time--- leaving the bag in the pot for an hour or two until it cools--- it's plenty strong.<br /><br />It's a big hit with guests, too.

Also, they do not last anywhere near an hour, more like 15-20 min., so just be warned, and be ready to taste things immediately after dissolving the pill in your mouth. In my experience, there have been a percentage of people for whom the tabs are not effective, maybe between 5-15% in a group (1-3 people per 20).

This salt tastes like regular $5 salt to me. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost nearly as much to ship it, but trust me when I tell you the Victoria brand is unlike anything you've ever tasted. I read the backs of both jars and this one is harvested from the whole island, where the Victoria brand is harvested from the one coast.

It is a dense, heavy bread with a slight sour taste.  My favorite sandwich to make with this?  Liverwurst!  Just a little bit of mayo, mustard and a few hearty rounds from an 8oz chub - and I'm in heaven :).  I really love how neat and square these make my sandwiches - like something you might serve at tea.  You cut the bread in half to make sandwiches since the individual slices are rectangle in shape.<br /><br />I'd like to point out that the ingredients listed by this seller is incorrect.  There is no whole meal wheat flour in this bread.  The ingredients for Mestemacher Pumpernickel (at least according to the package that I currently have) is as follows:<br />Whole Kernel Rye, Water, Wholemeal Rye Flour, Salt, Oat Fiber, Malt Extract, Yeast.<br /><br />Mestemacher also makes a Westphalian version of this bread, aptly named Mestemacher Westphalian Pumpernickle (it comes in a black package).  Personally, I think the Westphalian version has a little more flavor and for those who were disappointed with this version, you may want to give the Westphalian version a try.  It is a separate recipe with different ingredients which are as follows:<br />Whole Kernel Rye, Water, Sugar Beet Syrup, Salt, Malt Extract, Yeast.<br /><br />The only thing I really don't like about these breads is the limited shelf life once opened (5 days, refrigerated).  Though...  it's nice knowing that it's preservative free and truth be told, I've never had a problem going through a loaf in under 5 days (there isn't THAT much bread in each of these packages).

I only hope that my servitude will allow me to one day be reincarnated as a cat who gets to sleep in front of the heating vent all day, only rising for food and attention.<br /><br />Royal Canin is exceptional cat food.  My older, part Siamese kitty has bad teeth that are typical of his breed.  I have fed him everything from Purina Indoor to Iams to Eukanuba.  All of these he would eat whole and yak up on the floor.  Because his nutrition sucked, his coat was dull and he would shed and shed.  So I went on a search for something better.  I found Royal Canin.<br /><br />First off, when you open this bag (and it's resealable, so it won't get stale!), expect your cat to go nuts.  It actually SMELLS better than any other dry cat food I've found.  The first time I opened it, my older cat (didn't have the little one yet) tried to climb into the bag.<br /><br />So here are the pros:<br /><br />  -It's really appetizing/appealing.  For cats anyway.<br />  -The weird flat triangle shape makes it harder to yak up on the floor.<br />  -The higher amount of protein/fats (less ""filler"") means that it's easier to digest and less likely to be yakked up on the floor.<br />  -Within a couple of weeks you'll notice WAY less shedding and a shinier, more lustrous coat.  Kitty feels like bunny fur, shines like a mink.<br />  -Less shedding and a higher fat/oil content means less hairballs to yak up (mine does it VERY rarely anymore...maybe once every other month.  He just digests them now.<br />  -You can actually feed less than you would the other foods because less filler means more is digested.<br />  -Also means less poop.<br />  -And that poop is less stinky/nasty.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />  -It's more expensive.<br />  -When it's feeding time, your cat WILL NOT SHUT UP until you put it in the bowl.<br />  -If you really like stepping in cat yak or kicking it across the floor in the middle of the night in your bare feet, sorry, your mooshy toe days are numbered.<br /><br />So, don't be detered by the price (which is WAY cheaper here per pound than it is at PetCo...and with free shipping!), give it a try.  It's worth it if you want to be the best minion/slave you can possibly be (and increase your chances of being a cat in your next life!*).<br /><br />*Disclaimer: Purchase of Royal Canin does not guarantee purchaser will be reincarnated as a feline in any of their following lives.  This reviewer takes no responsibility for reincarnation disappointments."

I love the taste of maple, period. :D<br /><br />I've been buying pure maple syrup for many, many years and was thrilled when I found out about Grade B syrup several years ago.<br /><br />Contrary to most rating systems, with maple syrup, the higher the grade, the more intense the flavor. I've seen some say that this syrup tastes too much like molasses. That wasn't my experience at all. I did find that to be true the one time I bought Grade C..that was too strong for sure. I've purchased several gallons of maple syrup over the years. This brand was right up there with brands that are much higher in price.<br /><br />I also use this syrup for regular applications like pancakes and french toast. I enjoy the strong flavor and the fact that it's not watery like grade A syrup can be. It's a must for cooking. I make a maple-walnut praline ice cream with it that is simply luscious. I've also used it to make maple breads, cakes and candies.<br /><br />A caveat: Please be sure to refrigerate the syrup after opening it. Mold can form in maple syrup if left at room temperature too long after opening (weeks, not hours). If you do forget and get mold, you can strain the syrup through cheesecloth and then boil it for 10 minutes or so, but it's better to avoid it altogether.<br /><br />If you like Log Cabin, this may not be the sryup for you."

I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.""  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple."

When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!"

They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.

It has really helped me improve my health.  I get far less headaches that is for sure.  I used to wake up with terrible headaches and after tracing everything it could possibly be and getting rid of those triggers, I still had headaches.<br />Now, I drink at least 10 oz of coconut water per day and my headaches have been cut by 75%.  At night, I will often hydrate before bed.  At the gym, I put it in my sports bottle.  It is so much healthier than the Alligator Ade and colored vitamin waters.  During gym days, I'll drink as much as 22 oz.<br />It's just pure coconut water with so much potassium.  Low potassium can cause muscle cramping and cardiovascular irregularities. A can of this stuff is perhaps one of the quickest ways you can hydrate and help yourself if you are experiencing symptoms of heat stroke or severe dehydration or JUST feeling a bit sluggish.  It has been an amazing experience for me.<br />Google ""potassium and health"" and you will see all the benefits of just a few guzzles.  A banana has about 450 mgs of potassium while 10 oz of coconut water has 650 mgs.<br />Also, it is soothing on my stomach and doesn't exacerbate car sickness and IMO, is best very cold.<br /><br />About this brand, ""Nature Factor"".  I purchased it here on Amazon as it was on sale.  I like the can (vs. the box) because it chills in the frig better, but I would have to say it's not the best coconut water.  It's not bad, it's just not YUMMY.  It  has a satisfactory taste, almost a non existent taste.  Whereas other coconut waters, such as ""O.N.E."" and ""Harvest Bay"" brand tastes really good and ""Vita-Coco"" tastes sour-horrible.<br /><br />I do not buy the waters with added sugar.  That defeats the purpose of the healthy drink and it really doesn't need any added sweetness if it is a good, clean coconut water.<br /><br />Also, instead of stocking my earthquake emergency stash with water, I have stocked with cases of coconut water.  Think about it.  If you need to hydrate during an emergency situation where resources are limited, wouldn't the electrolytes and benefits of coconut water be better than just plain old water?  Each gulp would be 5 times more beneficial.<br /><br />If you are curious about coconut water, this is a decent enough brand to give it a try.  Since they all taste so different, it's interesting to try all the brands to see which one you prefer.  Good health to you all."

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

From the minute I first smelled its earthy, nutty scents (with hints of tobacco and leather), I knew it would be a delightful morning tea. I couldn't have been more right. For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I've experienced (without the bitterness of many ""bold"" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!"

I made a cold almond breeze matcha latte and slowly savored every sip. It truly tastes like what it purports to be. English toffee!

Thankfully most cats are pretty liberal and have no problems at all snorting the Cat Ganja and letting it all out.

Right away, when he got this chew, it became his favorite thing in the world -- he carries it around with him everywhere, takes it to bed, and was even smart enough to drop it in his water bowl to try to soften it up (that took most of the color out, but it must not have hurt the flavor because he seems even more interested in it now).

I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.

However, you can't beat the price. In our local supermarket, it is far cheaper than other GF products, and only a tad bit more than non-GF cake mix. Amazon's subscription-price isn't much lower than our supermarket, so I'll still buy it there.

I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.

I'm not exactly nuts about the energy drink fad either as I prefer to get my nutrition naturally. But this Vitamin Squeeze looked like it could be pretty good so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />There are a few problems off the bat. There's no real way of measuring how much to put in your cup. I guess you could use a measuring cup, but that seems like a hassle just to put something in your water. Beyond that, there's no way of fixing it if you put too much in. This drink requires a fair amount of finesse as there's no real margin for error.<br /><br />Beyond that, it tastes really fake. Like watered down kool aid infused with one of those vitamins that's not supposed to have an after taste but does. This drink is supposed to be an easier way to get your vitamins, but it certainly is not.<br /><br />I don't recommend this drink to anyone. It's possible that some people may enjoy this taste.

She had found one of these she'd left where I didn't see it and had chewed it to where the end was gooey and mushy.  I've read that if they swallow this part, it can get caught in their intestines and block them OR in their throat and choke them.  I threw them away after reading that and reading sad stories of others who had to take their dog to the vet, expensive surgeries and such.  I'll never buy them or anything like them again.  I don't get anything for her that is rawhide, can splinter, etc.  The best thing I've found for her to chew on that is edible and safe is called ""Beefeaters Sweet Potato Snacks For Dogs"".  Do a search here on amazon.com or on Google and you can find them from $8.99 and up, but they're worth it to have something safe for your dog to chew on.  They are all natural, satisfies her need to chew, is full of vitamins and most importantly, SAFE for her.  They come in a huge bag, so for my little 6 pounder, they last a long time.

At about one year old he developed a nasty skin rash with lesions that flaked and the hair would fall out. A couple of Vets said it looked like Staph and we tried SEVERAL rounds of antibiotics and medicated shampoos. None of them worked. I finally got frustrated and bought a bag of Orijen adult formula and flatly refused to give anymore people food. Eventually he gave in and decided to try the Orijen. Within 3 weeks to a month his rash was totally gone, his loose stools firmed up and he has a healthy doggie appetite and diet. At his last checkup I told the Vet about Orijen and he was intrigued.

First you can use it with the included treat caps.  Put one in and your dog will lick it and enjoy it for hours. Be sure you purchase the right size treat ball for your dog - buy one too small and the dog will be able to pop the treat out and chew it up in no time.  Purchase the right size and it will be impossible to remove the treat cap, which is exactly how the toy is supposed to work.<br /><br />Another way to use the cap is to fill it with EveryFlavor Treats (sold separately) by the same company. These are small, soft treats, in many different flavors, that spill out slowly while the ball is played with.  Again, the idea is that the treats are metered out slowly.<br /><br />You can also feed your pet his or her daily kibble in it if it's of small enough gauge.  If you need to, you can clip back the rubber on the ball to make it easier.<br /><br />You can also fill it with a mix of kibble and peanut butter for a double treat.<br /><br />We have these in all three sizes because we have pup's that fit all three.  We have to keep the pets separated while they have them or the Brittany heads straight for this one because he can pull the cap out in about 10 seconds and then chew it up and swallow it in about 2 minutes - a tasty treat which we try to keep him from enjoying!<br /><br />Disclaimer:  We sell this product in our store and it's one of our best-sellers but we use it on a daily basis and have since they started making them.

Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br /><br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong.

In this case, however, I made an exception, intrigued by the ""Dirty"" name on the bag and the low price in the local warehouse store.

Mine is a will of mashed potatoes.<br /><br />Dirty chips are a taste bonanza and a sensory delight. They are thick and crispy with an intense flavor one can't get enough of.

They are so tasty that I eat them when I have an urge for a crunchy salty snack like potato chips or pop-corn or really for no reason. For me they easily take the place of any wheat based cracker that I would use in soups or for tuna salad or cheese. The real hard part is not finishing off almost one of the bags once opened. You consume 2G of dietary fiber and 3G of protein per 15 crackers which is a serving size for 140 calories. Noteworthy they are made in the USA. I'll count the next time I snack, but in all honesty I think I eat about 30 as one snack usually w/ some form of Cabot's cheese. I enjoy trying different types of food items, but if you are a staunch saltine or Ritz cracker fan, these may not be for you. They are very thin, crunchy, have a salty nutty like flavor and I can faintly taste the soy sauce. Since there is no expiration date on the box (odd I know) I will stock up while I can get them locally at such a low price. The only packaging part I don't like is the 2 cellophane bags are not resealable.

They tasted fine...just not like the cheese whose name they wear. (The best flavours are original, the duoz with the smoked cheese flavour, and Swiss).

The vet ruled out more serious health issues, and speculated that it was an allergic reaction or food sensitivity.  And so began a year of cat food experiments...<br /><br />We tried a range of grain-free foods with various protein sources.  Some didn't help the skin; some she didn't like. The local pet food store suggested this.  The big selling point was that it doesn't have any ""meals""-- no ""chicken meal"" or ""fish meal"" or ""turkey byproduct"" or whatever.  She has been eating this for the past 6 months or so, and her skin has cleared up remarkably.  And the fact that she taps on my cheek until I wake up and feed her in the morning suggests that it is also quite delicious.<br /><br />It is expensive, but it has helped her skin issues enough that it's been worth it.

My pup is exactly 15 pounds right on the dot. So it's hard to find chews for him to actually enjoy and be able to hold it with his tiny paws. The Dingos are actually priced decently on amazon so I have no complaints about that. It's really hard to find cheap and good chews. It's great that he is able to chew it for about 45 minutes ~ 2 hours on each Dingo, depending if he ends up trying to hide some of them. That can give our family some alone time.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like it's that the chicken is dyed red. I don't think it's necessary to make the dingo stand out as long your pup can smell the chicken. Also the chicken is actually more appealing than the rawhide part. I'd try buying a bag of Pork Chomps Twists(Pork Skin Rawhide, with no chicken meat) and it seemed like he was more interested in the Pork Chomp Twist than the Dingo with the chicken. Makes me wonder?<br /><br />The bag also says that this product was MADE IN CHINA...a bit dangerous?<br /><br />Anyhow I will only buy the Pork Chomp Twists (30 pack) once in a while because it only usually last less than 10 minutes which is a disappointing. They also cost more than Dingos. So I am going to stick to the daily Dingo ritual and give him a Pork Chomps Twist on special occasion like the holidays or his birthdays.<br /><br />Edit: I might switch to a better alternative because I really don't want to continue to feed Stitch rawhide and red dyes. Hopefully I can find something better as our daily ritual than Dingos."

The cracker is, indeed, similar, but the seaweed wrapper is not. The crackers are dense, fresh, crispy and have a pleasing taste with the merest hint of sweetness. However, the seaweed that is wrapped around them is not very good. It is not salty (a pleasant surprise) and has a slightly fishy taste (which I expected), but the first cracker I ate tasted like fish-scented soap and had a very ""chemical"" aftertaste. After eating several of these crackers, I have become somewhat used to their taste. I still taste the soap flavor, and the chemical aftertaste is still there, too, but it is not as strong as it was with the first cracker.<br /><br />I am not sure what the manufacturing process is, with what the seaweed may be treated, or what I am going to do with the 11 bags of these I have not yet opened.

It was a bad idea. The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.<br /><br />I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: ""a Greenie got stocked in his intestine"".<br /><br />I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. ""Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds"". Dogster-com<br /><br />Note that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.<br /><br />In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog."

Only making wine for a little over a year... In the past year, however, I made about 11 kits from different manufactures.<br /><br />This wine, Tuscany Rosso Magnifico, is quite fantastic.  I made it at 5 gallons by putting in all of the juice concentrate, but only re-constituting with water up to the 5 gallon mark.  I also added 30 Grams of Oak Chips.  Now, I personally don't like a lot of oak in a wine.  For that reason, I don't like many commercial wines...  30 Grams of Oak is enough not to actually taste excessive oak, but have a better mouth feel.  I got the oak from a home brew close to where I live.  Medium Toasted Oak.  Again, it is just my opinion, but less is more with the oak... You should trust your tongue, and not worry about what others say.  You can always add more oak, you can't take it away...<br /><br />I put the oak in the carboy for the secondary fermentation.  Not in the bucket.  I learned that from copying a Mosti Mondale kit.  Some kits but oak dust in the primary...  So far, I have had good luck with the oak chips in the secondary.<br /><br />The wine does taste much better, if you let it sit in the bottle 6 months after you bottle it.  But, you will most likely not be able to wait that long....  Put 3 or 4 bottles away to age, if you can't wait for the whole batch...<br /><br />To learn about the process, I learned everything I know from looking at the videos on the finevinewines.com website.  It may be helpful if you never did it, to look at the process and once you see it, you will be confident that you can do it...  You can also look to youtube for a few good demonstrations...<br /><br />You will need some equipment to do this, but you don't need more than a beginner equipment kit to be successful.  Once you do it, you will be hooked...  I typically do two or three at a time... At the time of this writing, I am doing WE Nero D'Avalo, WE Chocolate Raspberry Port, Vino Italiano Merlot.  When I get a free carboy, I will do the Rosso Magnifico again.  Mrs.Claus got  it to me for Christmas.<br /><br />By the way, everyone who has tried my Rosso Magnifico loves it...<br /><br />See what I mean.  You will get hooked...<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you out there.<br /><br />Cheers!"

And throw in the fact that it has no calories, zero glycemic index, no artifical ingredients.  This Wholesome Sweeteners product has an advantage in that it is organic, while not all stevia products are.  I'm very sensitive to pesticides in our food products, so I really appreciate organics.  This stevia is packaged much like the thin packages of artificial sweetener, and it is processed into a fine powder.  The individual packets are sealed well with an airtight paper.  The box says that each packet has the equivalent taste of 2 teaspoons of sugar.  That's probably about right, as I drink my coffee without creamer, so I like it just a tad sweet.  When opening the package, the stevia powder flows right out when poured, no clumping, and it dissolves quickly.  I've heard some people say that stevia is an acquired taste, but I've loved the taste of stevia in my coffee since the first time I tried it.  My only reservation about the Wholesome Sweeteners product, and this won't affect 99% of all consumers out there, but as a gluten-intolerant, I am very aware if any product has a disclaimer saying that this product is processed in shared facilities where wheat products are processed.  It does also list a handful of other common allergans that are processed at the same facility.  Now, chances are there isn't any cross-contamination of the allergans in the stevia product.  However, it's something that causes me to have to make a decision whether I want to take a chance on the potential for cross-contamination.  Anyway, that's my issue.  For everyone else, this is a great tasting product, it's organic, no calorie, I strongly recommend it for those reasons.  Would be 5 stars, if not for the cross-contamination potential."

My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food."

So buy a Toddy Maker and brew your own.<br /><br />Also, the owner stole this idea from a guy who needed a permit for it (back in 1987) to start a manufacturing facility from the City of New Orleans, where the owner (McCrory) was working.

One would logically assume, given this company's stellar reputation for quality, that Coconut M&M's would have coconut in them.  One would assume that, but one would be wrong.  Instead, it's just a regular M&M with a slight hint of a god-awful artificial coconut flavor with an overwhelming aftertaste.

It seems like this happens a lot with this product after reading through the comments. When I found my package on the porch today it looked like UPS had dragged it behind the truck all the way here.<br />It was not in a rectangular shape any longer. After opening it I saw that the good people at Amazon had wrapped the whole case of jars with bubble wrap. I felt much better when I saw this. I even had trouble getting the wrap off the case of jars, but when I did,the first thing I smelled was Anchovies. Not good! Then I saw that a quarter of the top of the case was wet with olive oil. Even worse! Then I saw that the tape that Crown Prince had sealed the case up with had been cut open. I don't think it would have made it out their door this way personally. Now I love Amazon and spend so much money with them I should be part owner by now, but I will have to say this was done at their warehouse and someone saw the oil on the case and cut it with a knife to look inside the case and just shipped it anyway. I have four jars that are covered in oil and no way of knowing really which ones are leaking. I suspect that it must be one or all of those four. Now while I have not looked close enough at the four yet to see if there is a fine crack in the bottles or the lids are loose, I have read in others comments where their jars were broken. I have them sitting on a piece of printer paper to see which ones leak. Now I don't know how many of you have ever eaten bad seafood before, but I have and don't ever want to do it again!  So now I have eighteen jars of anchovies at a rather high price to begin with, and really don't know if any of them are safe to eat. My point here is to let you know if your going to order any food from Amazon, don't order anything in a glass jar. I wouldn't want to read about you in the obits. And Amazon, if your going to sell food, do it safely, because if I die eating any of these anchovies, your going be out a lot of bucks when I can't one click anymore!"

Finally picked up a bag when we ran out of our Lundberg Akitakomachi rice (good stuff -- try it), and was pleasantly surprised. I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine.

This isn't as good as something like Vita Coco though, but about the same in taste as Zico coconut water I'd say. It's not bad at all. The nutritional content is very impressive and completely identical to that of Vita Coco and Zico.This product contains dextrose which is the same as glucose and is actually the only sugar that is good for the body and works in the blood to feed your cells, and be rest assured, this dextrose is not from corn, its made from tapioca. Mixability of this product is superb, add water, stir, and like a minute later its all mixed perfectly, I still like to let it sit for about 5 minutes though. The package recommends 1 tablespoon per 8 ounces but I found that the coconut flavor is just to light for me so I do a tablespoon and a half and thats perfect for me. All in all a great product, I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have to use more then a tablespoon per 8 ounces, It costs a little more doing it that way and I'm going for a cheap alternative. This is still cheaper then regular coconut water though even though I use more. I personally think this should be priced at $8.99."

None of the PB's had much flavor, kinda bland. I noticed it was very runny - so we stirred em up a bit and put them in the fridge to stiffen up. A day or so later, we tried them again - even more bland from the fridge. Maybe I didn't stir em up enough? I don't know - but now they're too hard to stir at all, so we'll see if we have the will to finish a jar or two if they get any more flavorful? Overall, we think it's way overpriced for the taste. We won't be buying any more jars, which is a shame cause I did want to support the fledgling company. I do wish them the best of luck though. To be fair we ONLY tried the 3 PB flavors. Nothing else..

Period.,"I grew up in the days before microwave ovens, and I recall eating popcorn that was popped in a wire basket over a fireplace, as well as popped in a ""hot air"" popper and in all kinds of configurations on the stove-top, including the entertaining ""Jiffy-Pop"" that started off in an aluminum-foil covered pie pan and ended up fluffing up that aluminum-foil higher than a 1960's bee-hive hairdo.<br /><br />Microwave popcorn has become so adept at using that now-universal kitchen device, I think I'd have a microwave if only for popcorn.<br /><br />That being said - you can SEE that there are scads of competing brands.  Still back before microwaves there were commercials starring Orville Redenbacher, and geeky as that guy seemed, he seemed to know something about popcorn.<br /><br />NOW we have microwaves and, frankly, Orville's off-spring haven't kept up.  ""Pop-Secret"" just plain pops better - their Popped kernels come out big and fluffy and just about every kernel pops.  I empty the bag and the familiar residue of a teaspoon of unpopped kernels just plain isn't there.<br /><br />THAT would be reason enough to rejoice, but Pop-Secret exceeds my expectations.  Back in the days when we popped our own popcorn by time-consuming laborious processes, the key to enjoying the popcorn was what you did AFTER the popping - just before putting the stuff in your mouth.  Back in those days mom taught us to melt a bit of butter and sprinkle that with just a touch of salt onto our snowy stacks of popped corn.  DEEEEEE-licious.<br /><br />In the years since some palates have been trained to become used to that greasy, sticky, oily stuff that's served in our nation's movie theatres. Okay if that's all you can get.... BUT - why would you want that at HOME?<br /><br />Pop-Secret Homestyle must have picked Momma's brain, because it comes out just like Momma's best - big, fluffy popcorn coated with just a touch of salt and Land-o-Lakes butter.<br /><br />I love popcorn.  The Mrs. makes fun of me for how much I love it, but I think the Mrs. and God understand.  Pop-Secret Homestyle is not only the BEST doggone popcorn you can get, but stick a bag in your microwave, push the ""popcorn"" button, and a few minutes later you have a little bag of heaven.  Open and enjoy.<br /><br />One piece of advice from an expert: Before putting the bag in the microwave, flatten out the bag - as much as possible flatten out the little kernels - separating them from one another.  This makes for more uniform popping and you get that ""no unpopped kernel"" experience."

Colonna,0/0,4.0,1338854400,Nice Cup Of Coffee In A Convenient Pack!,"I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter. Basically, I would opt for a Dunkin before a Starbucks, just to give you an idea of what I normally drink as I review Marley One Love Coffee.<br /><br />The box contains 15 single serving pods, individually sealed in foil. Each pod contains about 1/3 of an ounce of coffee. They are very convenient for storage or taking on the road. The cardboard box has a cutout near the bottom to easily dispense the pods (or you can just open the box from the top). The coffee is advertised as ""100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.""<br /><br />I typically make my coffee in a Keurig or a standard coffee maker/filter. I tried One Love four ways, ONLY ONE OF WHICH IS THE RECOMMENDED USE, as the coffee is advertised as ""for use only in single serve home coffee pod brewers"". Why did I order this coffee without said pod brewer? When I travel I find more and more hotels have pod brewers, so I am interested in a good coffee to use on the road. Anyway, I made the coffee:<br /><br />1) In a single serve brewer, a Black and Decker Brew N Go,<br />2) By filling a Keurig reusable K-Cup/filter.<br />2) In my standard coffee maker, a Braun, using the pods in the same amount/weight as I would any loose coffee.<br />3) Steeping a pod in a coffee mug, approximately 7 1/2 ounces in size.<br /><br />Unlike many coffees, where I think ""Wow that smells really good"", only to be disappointed by the flavor, Marley One Love hit me just the opposite. When I smelled the unused pod, as well as the brewing coffee, I thought ""Hmmm, that doesn't smell too great."" But wow, the result is a really nice cup of coffee. One Love is not at all bitter, and I wouldn't even call it bold. It is mild to medium in taste, while not being weak at all. I found I got the best results using it in the Keuring or regular coffee makers. Steeping it was OK, but it was somewhat weaker that way.<br /><br />I would get this coffee again, either loose in the bag or in pods."

My only advice is to let it steep for a long time--maybe 15 minutes--and NOT to add too much water.

[Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the ""good stuff""]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one."

SPIEGEL ""Joe""",0/0,5.0,1350172800,Worthy successor to the original,"NECTRESSE Natural No Calorie Sweetener, 140 Serving Canister<br /><br />I've been using original Splenda (sucralose) since it came out years ago. ""Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar."" I heard that countless times on TV. Well, I never thought it was totally accurate, but it was the best sugar free, calorie free sweetener that I ever tried. Well the time has come and the patent has run out. There are now numerous sucralose clones on the market, so the Splenda Company has brought a new product on that they can sell exclusively, for now. That is, Nectresse, a new calorie free sweetener derived from the Monk Fruit. It too is partially derived from sugar, as sugar is a listed in gradient. Still, there are no calories at least in modest quantities. It is also listed as diabetic friendly. I am most interested in the calorie count and cost, oh it needs to taste good too.<br /><br />The package that I got is the tub with a double flip lid. One side opens to reveal a large opening for using a spoon; the other has a small hole to shake some out. The measure is ¼ tsp. of Nectresse is equal to 1 tsp. of sugar, a 4:1 ratio. So a little goes a long way, as is typical with Splenda and other products. I also received in the mail at about the same time two envelopes of Nectresse. They are not like regular Splenda envelopes. They are using a thicker lines paper, more like Splenda with Fiber. My thought on that is less shelf stability than the original Splenda. My container has an expiration date of June 2013 so my guess is about a year of shelf life, so be wary of buying too much.<br /><br />I generally use sweeteners on my morning cereal, like Shredded Wheat and Cheerios. Those have no or little sugar and I like to boost then a bit. I don't sweeten tea or coffee and I don't bake so I'll leave others to review those characteristics. I know very well what original Splenda tastes like in the cereal game. Nectresse is really nice. It has a bit of a fruit characteristic in its sweetness. It works very well with my breakfast. I had no aftertaste or other unpleasantness. I was quite pleased. My large box of Splenda is starting to run low and I definitely see myself getting Nectresse as a replacement. The Splenda website is still offering the free samples if you'd like to give it a try before committing to a jug or box. I'd advise that if you're uncertain. My feeling is I liked it a lot."

It is simply the spices and seasonings you add to the quesadilla recipe on the package. So you'll need extra ingredients. And once you've made one quesadilla casserole, you don't have to buy the packets again. Why? Well...see below.<br /><br />First, consider the price ($6.99 at the current time). That's hefty for a few teaspoons of seasonings! By the way, I've also tried Mccormick Recipe Inspirations for Rosemary Roasted Chicken with Potatoes and while it was delicious, I didn't need to Inspirations package to create the exact same meal the next time around.<br /><br />Why? Because McCormicks lists each ingredient (in that case, paprika, crushed rosemary leaves, garlic and ground black pepper) and even notes the required amount of teaspoons to use for each spice or seasoning. So all you really have to do is save the back of the Inspirations packages and you can create the same meals - at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />Yes, it may cost more the first time you purchase an entire box or jar of spices. But you'll end up saving money in the long run because they'll last far longer, making them far more economical. So by all means, grab a couple of the Inspirations seasoning packets to get the recipes for some yummy meals. After that, you can easily recreate the results. After all, it is all spelled out for you."

After all, once you get beyond proper roasting, there isn't a whole lot you can say about nuts other than what you add to them. If you bury them in salt, or immerse them in chocolate, you are getting more flavor, but the trade off is unwanted cane sugar, and/or salt; so these make a pleasant bridge.<br />Extra added flavor with the thin coat of dark chocolate cocoa powder (that doesn't get on your fingers by the way), while only ingesting 25mg of sodium in a single 1/4 cup serving.<br />When I first started to eat them, I thought the dry unsweetened cocoa powder didn't add anything desirable to the flavor, but as I progressed to finishing about a 1/4 cups worth, I began to realize that this could very well become a strongly acquired taste.<br />If I had to be critical of the entire presentation, I would note that the plastic ""jar"" has a threaded top with 2 half circle single threads partially overlapping each other that results in a not so very snug closure. With very little effort you can snug them at closure and skip right past snug to loose again, so much so that if you dropped the container the lid may pop off, spilling the contents.<br />I am not commenting on the way they are sealed though, they did an outstanding job of that. You have to pop open the plastic seal over the top of the lid edge, just to remove the screw on top, and then once open, there is an internal air tight seal to keep the contents fresh, and they are. Overall highly recommended, especially if you are nuts about nuts."

Because I just can't give up that fizziness, or the caffeine, or something.  And while these Sparkling Ice drinks may not have caffeine, they definitely have the fizz that I so enjoy in my drinks.  And the flavors aren't half bad either.  In fact, this Pink Grapefruit one is one of the better ones.<br /><br />I don't like grapefruit.  So why did I buy a flavored drink with that then?  Well there's something about this grapefruit taste that I like.  It's not too sour, but not too sweet either.  And considering I avoid the real fruit I can't say whether or not that it tastes like the real thing, I would think it's probably pretty close.  But it's just good, easy to drink, and definitely refreshing.  And there isn't an overabundance of flavors to get crazy with.<br /><br />The ingredients; they actually aren't too bad.  The list isn't very long, and the flavorings are natural.  There's actual grapefruit in this bottle.  There's even green tea extract.  The problems come in the form of color.  There is a type of red dye in this drink.  And I'm not too impressed with that.  I'd rather they have made it a healthier drink and it be some other color or clear.  Honestly, I think I'd even pay more if they made it that way.  But this low list of ingredients has some other positives that come with it too.  There are 0 calories and 0 sugars in this drink.  Which is incredible.  And there's even some B vitamins thrown in too.<br /><br />So while the dye makes it a tad less than healthy, this is still a pretty good soda substitute.  It's healthy, still has the fizz, and tastes good.  I definitely will keep buying it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why."

542577,B001CD0YWS,A2UA08RMUZZ2EO,C. E. Borrowman,3/3,2.0,1335052800,False/Misleading advertising and a health conscious coffee drinker's perspective...,"I started with the 1/2 tspn serving on the label for Just Like Sugar, and went up to about 10 times for sweet coffee.<br /><br />I drink coffee black most of the time, but when I use sweetener I expect it to be sweet with a reasonable amount in accordance with the serving size on the label.  This was not the case with Just Like Sugar (JLS).<br /><br />Based on my experience, which seems to be in accordance with some other reviewers here, instead of ""330 servings"" as listed on the 5.82 oz container, if you drink only one 6 oz cup of coffee a day, this product will last you anywhere from two weeks to a month and you will get 15-33 servings, if that is all you use it for.  I drink a small pot of coffee (5 cups) a day, so if I sweetened every cup, it would last me 3 - 6 days.  Fortunately I don't drink sweet coffee that often so I won't have to pay an extra $30 a month just for sweetener.<br /><br />Cost:  By Amazon's pricing, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002714IUI"">N'JOY Pure Cane Sugar - 8/22 oz. Canisters</a> is .12 cents per ounce, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84"">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> is $5.37 per ounce, and JLS is $1.80 per ounce (note that the $1.40 per ounce listed at this time by Amazon is also inaccurate) for the 5.82 oz container listed here at $10.49, however, the Stevia differs in strength.  Pure stevia extract is up to 300 times sweeter than sugar, and a 3.5 oz container contains 2381 servings.  JLS claims it is just as sweet as sugar, so by this statement you are paying more than ten times the amount of money you would for plain sugar.  Going by a .5 gram serving (as listed on the JLS label) and dividing each ounce by 56 (for .5 grams in each ounce), sugar is .002 cents per .5 g serving while JLS is .03 cents, and Pure Stevia Extract (PSE) is .008 cents per serving ($18.81 for 3.5 oz divided by 2381 servings).  Not only is this product almost 4 times more expensive than PSE, but the stevia extract is more potent per serving, and actually does sweeten an entire cup of coffee with just one serving.  Judging by the sweetness, you could probably go with just a half serving of stevia vice 10 times or more the recommended serving of JLS.  By this measure, JLS could be up to 80 times more expensive than stevia.<br /><br />I was introduced to this product in reading Dr. Blaylock's Wellness report, which I find helpful most of the time.  He says it is his favorite, so he may be simply enamored with a product that has no real proven adverse side effects and can be used as an alternative to sugar, which has many.  For those who happen to be Jewish, the product is apparently kosher, as the label also has the stamp of approval from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.<br /><br />Taking the recommended 1/4 teaspoon serving straight, JLS is light and fluffy, with a very slight crunchiness until it dissolves into a sticky texture.  There is little aftertaste, and it is relatively close enough to sugar to serve as an alternative, if you just ate sugar and didn't care about texture.  I have not found a sweetener yet that actually tastes the same as sugar, and even if it did, it probably would not have the same effects as scientific studies have shown sugar to have (opiate like).<br /><br />Conclusion:  While Just Like Sugar is probably better for your health than sugar, I believe Pure Stevia Extract is even better and may cost up to 80 times less per serving than JLS.  Of course, the healthiest option would be not using any sweetener whatsoever, but since you are here on a sweetener page, I recommend the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84"">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> (PSEP) from Kal instead of this product.  Just remember, it is 300 times sweeter than sugar, so you don't have to use nearly as much.  There can be an aftertaste with stevia, but using the correct amount helps tremendously, and the aftertaste is sweet, not acrid.  The Kal PSEP product comes with a very tiny scoop, which I found more than enough (I could probably go with half that) to sweeten a full 9 oz mug of coffee.  Also, be sure to get ""pure"" stevia extract and verify that is the only ingredient on the nutrition label, as many other ""stevia"" products have fillers and chemically derived components of stevia.  Sweetleaf seems okay (I haven't tried it yet), as it's only other ingredient is inulin soluble fiber, which may be conducive to health, but it is much more expensive and much less potent.  Watch out for products like Truvia, which contains Erythritol (a sugar alcohol) as the main ingredient, rebiana (synthetically derived with chemical processes from stevia), and other ""natural flavors"" which can be just as bad, or even worse than some artifical flavoring (same chemicals, but can be unnaturally processed from natural sources)."

Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).  The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.  It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect ""unwinding"" drink before bedtime.  Not ""spicy"" in the classic sense at all, either.  I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea."

Now that I can get them from Amazon, feeding my addiction is easier and more convenient.<br /><br />Although I generally like BBQ and spicy foods, most BBQ flavored chips and jalepeno/salsa/hot flavored chips taste somewhat bland and very artificial to me. It's not that I can't taste the flavors; it's just that they don't seem to resemble the actual taste of BBQ or peppers or salsa, etc. But with these chips, it really tastes like eating crisp french fries smothered in ketchup, and licking my bright red fingertips clean is half the fun!<br /><br />Packaging was a little excessive. Looks like Herr's ships their standard store-delivery box (already well padded) to Amazon which puts the entire Herr's box into an Amazon box for shipment to you.

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.

For the amount that I had paid, I would have certainly expected at least a little bit more in the package. The bag is roughly the size of a small bag of chips, but is inflated with a lot of air. Each small package inside contains two candy beads roughly the size of large pearls. So the package appears small for the large price and the amount of candy inside is smaller still.<br /><br />I wasn't completely disappointed, though.

Both of my dogs got extremely sick thanks to this food!,"First of all, the ""gain control"" formula is a true joke and has a very deceiving label!!!! One of my dogs gained more than 20 pounds in less than 6 months!!!!!! After 6 months, he could no longer hold the food down as he started vomiting the food and have watery diarrhea 4 to 5 times a day and he would start shaking because he could not hold the food in.  We were so concerned that we took him right away to the vet and vet requested us to change his diet immediately.  We did and his diarrhea stopped right away.  Prior to giving him this food, he was healthy and then coincidentally, he started to have major health problems.<br /><br />Furthermore, we got him a companion dog in excellent health condition who was used to eating mainly dry food and we gave her some of this food and to determine whether this food just had an impact (or negative allergic reaction) on our first dog and whether she would be affected or not.  Sure enough, same first day she ate her first bowl of this Buffalo brand food, she had diarrhea and she even woke us up at 2am the first night because she could not hold it anymore. She had diarrhea 6 times in just 24 hours.  A side note on this dog, she has a strong stomach because prior to adopting her, the previous owners told us she eats just about anything from fruits, vegetables, different dry foods and her stomach does not get upset.<br /><br />After all this nightmare and realizing there is no quality at this Buffalo corporation,  we now have started to give them real organic food made by us since we could no longer trust these dog food companies and our older dog has immediately lost the weight he gained thanks to that disgusting, toxic and cheap food. If you have ever watch the movie ""Food Inc"" and have realized what food is available for human beings, just imagine what type of food these dog food Corporations are selling to our dogs (babies)!<br /><br />Now meal time with our home made food is their favorite time of the day, they absolutely love it and start jumping up and down something that never happened with any type of dry food.  Today to our surprise, we found out that THIS PRODUCT IS BEING RECALL FOR CONTAINING TOXIC INGREDIENTS. We are shocked that by giving them this Buffalo food, we were putting in great danger the lives of our beloved dogs.  If you really love your dog and he/she is truly part of your family, make him/her their own food to protect their health and life. Is really easy to make and does not take that much time.  There are books in Amazon that guides you through the food dogs should and should not eat. Now our dogs eat real chicken, brown rice, veggies, and a spoon of organic multi-vitamin which we mix it all together when serving.  This will not only make them happier, healthier, stronger, but also increase their lifespan.<br /><br />The info below will show you some of the reality and suffering of those who have fed their dogs with Buffalo food:<br /><br />truthaboutpetfood com /articles/more-worrisome-news-on-blue-buffalo-dog-food.html"
496945,B005HG9ET0,A2AWVROFGSZU4E,My Fake Name,0/1,4.0,1346284800,Not for giraffe-rinsing,"****<br /><br />For several years I have been seriously studying various bottled waters, and after researching this particular one quite thoroughly I have reached a number of conclusions, which I will now reveal for free despite the fact these tests have cost me a lot of time and money over the years.<br /><br />First, it's mostly water.  In fact, it is for all practical purposes all water.<br /><br />According to my high-quality, thoroughly calibrated pH meter, which I reviewed elsewhere, the alkalinity of this particular bottle of water is much closer to 9.3 than 9.5, but that's only 2.105% lower, which I think makes no difference unless you drink dozens of gallons a day and dozens more a night, which if you do might come you down with hyponatremia.<br /><br />This water has a particular taste both in the mouth during drinking and afterwards.  Unlike trying to describe exactly how a wine tastes - ""An insouciant trace of dried foxglove petals masked almost but not completely by overarching reminiscences of the mature essences of oak barrels and lightly smoked hedgehog droppings,"" you know what I mean - trying to describe how the product under review tastes is simpler.<br /><br />Water.<br /><br />It tastes like water.<br /><br />It tastes like water as you're drinking it.<br /><br />After you've finished drinking some and you wait awhile to see whether there's any degree of afterbirth, there isn't.  It's exactly as though you had drunk water.  Which you had.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It freezes at 31.875 degrees Fahrenheit.  It boils at 210.77 degrees, not the 212 you might have expected, because I conducted the testing at 720 feet above MSL, but the point is that the boiling point of pure water at 720 feet up is 210.76 degrees.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It puts out a campfire just as well as tap water, and it puts out a campfire just as well as bottled water that doesn't contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, which is alkaline, which raises the pH level), dipotassium phosphate (derived exclusively from meteorites), magnesium sulfate (found only in certain caves in the Lesser Antilles islands), and calcium chloride (essence of limestone).<br /><br />****<br /><br />Amazon Vine Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12), when bought in that quantity, amounts to 18 liters of water, which is 4.7551 gallons if you merely type ""18 liters in gallons "" into Google, which weighs 39.701 pounds, which is extremely close to the 39 pounds 11 ounces you would expect from pure water according to Wolfram when you enter ""18 liters water in pounds.""<br /><br />It works well in a squirt gun, which I still think more people should carry around just in case.<br /><br />At room temperature Essentia works well as a rinse after you've shampooed your hamster or your parakeet, and it works just as well after you've shampooed your giraffe but it takes a lot more, which gets expensive compared to just using tap water through a garden hose, believe you me.  For this I subtract one star.<br /><br />****"

Amazon makes a simple transaction, allowing me to purchase everything from one site.  the shipping didn't take nearly as long as expected.  i got them 10 days before the earlier estimated date.  some would say the cost is a bit much, especially since shipping costs a little less than the item itself.  considering that i haven't had these in 7 years and they were my favorite kind of M&M's when they were here, i think it's worth getting a bag every now and then.  it's cheaper than going to Germany or Australia and getting them there.  as an occasional treat, i'll enjoy having these be available.<br /><br />they taste better than i remembered.  i believe anyone who loved Crispy M&M's before they were removed from America and lives here will find it to be worth the price.  i also believe anyone who hasn't tried these is missing out on something really great.  i'd say this bag is the perfect size for its price.  i've seen slightly bigger ones on other sites with twice the shipping cost.  308 grams with 17 dollar shipping?  i don't think so.  i'd rather get these here.  less hassle and much cheaper to ship, even considering the increase in weight for the larger bag.<br /><br />my only truly negative comment on this is that the picture makes it look like a huge bag and i'm horrible at the Metric system, so i was expecting a bigger bag.  it's still a decent side, but there should be a ratio to American measurements somewhere in the description for those of us who can't convert stuff to Metric.  i'm more at fault, for i judged it by appearance rather than researching it, finding a unit converter online, etc. however, i'm sure many people will make a similar miscalculation.<br /><br />in all, i love that this product is here.  because of the price to import it, it won't be something i get very often, but it's definitely worth an occasional addition.  i love the idea of having these as a treat.  every once in a while, i'll add it to my other purchases, whether it's a special occasion or simply a craving for one of the most brilliant confectioneries i've had in my lifetime."

Offenbach,15/15,5.0,1251504000,I'd buy this again and that says alot,"We eat a lot of rice, usually brown rice or red rice or the darker grains and most times use an electric rice cooker unless I'm preparing risotto.  There are instances, however, when I simply don't have the time to prepare rice and until now, I didn't consider options other than freezing leftover rice in small packages for emergencies.  I never cared for Uncle Ben's Minute Rice and assumed that any prepared and packaged rice would be similar to that rice which one of my sisters adores.  Annie Chun's Rice Express Multi-Grain Sticky Rice has proven my aversion was unwarranted because this product has turned out to be a lifesaver when having only a minute's time.  Now if you don't have a microwave or pot with water and source of heat, I don't think this would be very good, but if prepared as directed, it's quite delicious and I'll buy it again.  The texture is like sticky rice, the flavor is like multi-grains, the color is speckled and appealing, and it's great to have at work with leftovers.  Sprouted brown rice is a definite winner.  Since no refrigeration is needed, it's safe in a drawer and is a relief even when you have forgotten to bring in something else.  In my opinion, since it's rice, you can add practically anything and have an enjoyable meal full of good carbs.  With no oil or salt added, you cannot go wrong with this rice!  Finalize those details according to your own tastes and dietary restrictions.  Because of the cost, I'll continue preparing rice in the electric rice cooker, but for appropriate times, this will be a household staple."

In the past I bought fresh heavy cream in the dairy section and often didn't get the whole container used before it went bad.  This canned cream is the answer to the problem.  The cans are small (7.6 oz) so there's less waste, and with the reduced fat content I can feel good about adding it to my family's food. It has a nice creamy texture and real cream taste without any metallic flavor from the can. The fact that it doesn't have to be refrigerated before opening means I can keep it in the pantry, too.<br /><br />This cream also whips well for dessert toppings - just add some sugar and use a whisk or electric beater, and whip until it becomes whipped cream.  Unlike ""Cool Whip"" this product doesn't contain lots of unknown preservatives and ingredients, and you'll have to use it soon after whipping it so it doesn't melt.<br /><br />At $1.40 per can (the last time I bought it) and free SuperSaver shipping, this is a good value."

My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are water sufficient for processing, meat by-products, chicken, turkey, and wheat gluten. At least there is chicken and turkey in it, which is the only reason it got more than 1 star from me. But other than that its all nasty stuff. Wheat Gluten is just gross and by-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods."

Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker."

And Decaf, too!","*****<br /><br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits.""<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"

Even so, I am happier feeding my cats something that comes closer to what they would eat in the wild -- almost all protein, no fillers like Soy or Wheat or Corn.<br /><br />The major ingredients in Instinct Grain Free Chicken Formula are: Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Broth, Chicken Liver, Ground Flaxseed, Montmorillonite Clay, Eggs, Peas, Carrots, Lecithin, Vitamins (and fruits) -- REAL meat is first, then broth, then liver  -- good solid nutrition for Obligate carnivores -- which is what cats are.<br /><br />I also like what is stated on the Instinct Cat Food website - ""Instinct foods are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your cat's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs. Instinct is also highly digestible and nutritionally dense""<br /><br />One of my cats (17 yrs old, but still thinks she is a kitten) has a very sensitive stomach -- but there is nothing in this formula, not even the flaxseed and the montomorillonite clay --to upset her stomach -- the other cat (14) has thyroid and heart issues -- after eating this food, her fur is shining and she moves like a frisky kitten. I would prefer not to feed my cats something that I know has dead bodies of downers or chicken feet or beaks/feathers. I feel more comfortable spending a little more and feeding them something that is purer, cleaner and healthier for them -- Instinct is one such food. Instinct also markets raw and freeze-dried foods as well. I feel that Instinct has a committment to making the best possible nutrition available to cat owners.<br /><br />Tha being said. both of my cats have no problem enjoying their Instinct cat food meals. At first I mixed the Instinct half and half with what they had been formerly eating (it was good food, the best I could afford, but still with rice as a filler) -- in order to make the transition easier on their stomachs. Now they dig into their Instinct and lick their plates clean (and ask for more).<br /><br />I plan to continue giving them Instinct Cat Food. Budget permitting, I may even try the freeze dried nuggets as a treat for them. I deserve the best nutrition-- certainly my cats should not be short-changed in that regard either."

I love my neighbor's cat and he apparently loves me, but I can live without the dead birds he constantly brings me. I spread some of this stuff around and he hasn't ""gifted"" me all summer. Also people's dogs seem to lift up their heads and trot briskly away from my yard instead of nosing around with interest for a comfortable spot to squat so I would say it did work on animals with sensitive noses. The problem is we had so much frequent rain this year (2-3 times per week for about 5 or 6 weeks) and I had to reapply so often it just ran out so fast. That's not the manufacturer or the product's fault, but I may have to try the hot chili pepper and powder before I decide buy more."

The same thing happened with Wellness treats. If your dog would eat anything I would recommend this, but if your dog is a picky eater, you should have other foods as a back up option.

After about a week of having one each morning and taking a few into work for light ""on the go"" snacks, I grew to like them. Chewy, decent (but not overpowering) fruit flavor and filling. That is when I decided I might buy some of these to incorporate into my breakfast routine.<br /><br />After seeing the price, I can confidently say that as good as these bars are, I will not be buying them. They are simply overpriced. The taste is decent (though I agree with another reviewer that there is way more fig than strawberry), the taste is not outstanding or significantly better than the run-of-the-mill breakfast bars at your local grocery (the kind which are half as expensive). As each bar is 160 calories and 1.7 ounces, the bars are simply too small to pay the per-bar price (do the math and I think you'll agree; better yet, calculate a per-ounce price with 12 bars per package and you'll REALLY see what I mean). Yes, these are 'vegan' bars but unless you are vegan (I am not) and cannot find a lower-priced alternative, I'd say that these bars are priced higher than they are worth.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying that these aren't good bars. They have a nice chewy texture, are decently sweet without being sugary, and are a filling quick breakfast or mid-afternoon snack. I simply think it is a shame that they are priced so high. If they were priced lower, I'd have given these five stars."

Why?,"All beans are moderately high in antioxidants (and calories) but soybeans are the healthiest beans we can eat because:  (1)Soybeans contain phytoestrogens called, ""soy isoflavones"" (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), which have been shown to substantially reduce the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, numerous cancers, and bone fractures.  (2)Soy protein is the only plant-source protein that comes close to matching the quality of animal-source proteins.  The deficiency-critical amino acids, methionine, lysine, and phenylalanine are much more plentiful in soy protein than in any other plant-source protein including proteins from all other beans.  (3)Soybeans are rich in virtually every mineral listed on the label of a complete multi-vitamin or complete multi-mineral tablet.  (4)Soybean oil contains alpha-linolenic acid, a slightly beneficial short-chain omega-3 fatty acid.  Although canned soybeans are healthier for us to eat than all other canned beans, they are not as healthy to eat as the Japanese fermented soybean food called, ""natto,"" which contains very generous amounts of nattokinase, vitamin K2/MK-7, vitamin K2/MK-8, vitamin PQQ, and vitamin C (manufactured by the friendly bacteria, not the plant) in addition to soy isoflavones.  This Eden Organic Black Soybean product contains 140mg of soy isoflavones per can.  Eating 1 can per day will be more than enough to give us the maximum benefit from soy isoflavones.  Eden adds a small quantity of ""kombu,"" a delicious Japanese seaweed, into each can.  This adds a small amount of sodium.  Total sodium:  105mg per can.  A person on a salt-restricted diet might object to this (and give this product only 3 stars) but I don't mind because kombu is high in fucoidan, a very beneficial polysaccharide."

It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet.

Karavitis  I bought a pack of these at Target a couple of days ago, it was an impulse purchase, and quite unlike me.  I haven't chewed gum in years.  But the flavor option (mint ice cream was the other one) was compelling, as was the fact that this gum was sugarless.  (If you go to their website, it contains sorbitol, a sugar alcohol which shouldn't raise insulin levels, along with what appears to be every artificial sweetener available.)  Yes, it tastes JUST EXACTLY LIKE apple pie.  In fact, if you are on a low-carb diet, or just want something to satisfy your sweet tooth to avoid reaching for an after-dinner dessert, this is it.  As another reviewer noted, Wrigley needs to make this ""last longer"".  That may not be a real possibility, maybe there would be someway to make the gum even smaller, like Chiclets, so that one can chew on two or three in succession, and still stay at the 5 calorie level.  Great product, and I'm looking forward to all the exciting flavor possibilities that Wrigley is willing to take a chance on!  John V Karavitis, John Karavitis, Karavitis"

First, be careful and use a hydrometer when you make up the wine to volume. My kit made 20.5 Liters at 1.090 instead of 23. In fairness, the kit says it makes 23 L at 1.075 to 1.090. I opted for reduced volume in lieu of diluted wine.<br /><br />Secondly, the kit does not contain yeast starter nutrients and the kit instructions have you just sprinkle the dry yeast into the wine must. That's really not a good idea! I bought some GoFerm for rehydrating the yeast and some Fermaid K yeast nutrient to add during the fermentation. Rehydrated the yeast by sprinkling it into 6 grams of GoFerm suspended in 4 oz of water. After 30 min, I added 4 oz of white grape juice (no preservatives) to let the yeast start their metabolism.  After 6 hours, I added another 8 oz of grape juice and let the yeast grow overnight. Used this starter culture to innoculate the wine kit must. Added 3 grams of Fermaid K nutrient on the first day after pitching the yeast and 3 more grams when the must had fermented down to about 1.060 specific gravity.<br /><br />With those modifications and with some attention to the details of aeration and stirring, the kit makes a very good chardonnay. I'll give it 4 stars because the quality of components makes such good wine. However, if you just follow the kit instructions and sprinkle the dry yeast directly into the fermentation vessel, you run the risk of a very slow start and increased risk of contamination. If you don't add any yeast nutrients, you risk having stalled fermentation somewhere along the way. The yeast nutrients are cheap; they should be in the kit!"

I could almost drink this like an ordinary beverage.<br /><br />The power lasts long enough to get me through nearly my entire shift. Since it's carb-based, the power does run out, but late enough that I can coast on momentum. This stuff lasts way longer than those energy shots, which peter out before my lunch break. It's also fairly inexpensive for an energy drink. Too many such beverages cost a small fortune, and I'd practically have to take out a second mortgage to power through my shift.<br /><br />So we have the trifecta: pleasing, powerful, and affordable.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

It seems as if it might be a whole grain, but it actually is a seed. It is grown  in the Andes Mountains of South America and is an ancient food highly prized by the Incas.<br /><br />Quinoa is very high in protein compared to grains, making it an excellent choice for vegetarians. It is also on the approved list for those on an alkaline diet as it is considered less acid than grains. Many people with gluten sensitivities substitute quinoa for wheat. When quinoa is rated on the glycemic index, it comes in at a very low 18, making it a great choice for people who are hypoglycemic, diabetic, or on a low-glycemic diet to lose weight.<br /><br />1 cup of cooked quinoa has this nutritional breakdown:<br />222 calories, which is 70% carbs, 15% fat, and 15% protein in this manner:<br />4 grams of (healthy) fat<br />39 grams of carbohydrates (5 grams of which is fiber)<br />8 grams of protein<br /><br />Quinoa contains folate, which is an important B vitamin, magnesium, phosphorous, copper and manganese.<br /><br />Quinoa can be ground into flour (I use my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000YRJT6"">Vita-Mix</a> to do that) and substituted for wheat flour in recipes for baked goods. The whole seed can be cooked just like rice. You use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of quinoa, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer about 15 minutes. When you see ring-shaped sprouts popping out of the quinoa seeds, it is almost finished. Stir it to make sure all the water is absorbed.<br /><br />Quinoa by itself tastes a bit bland, but that's actually an advantage in cooking as it can absorb the flavor of herbs and spices very well. It makes an excellent pilaf and a nice addition to a thick, hearty soup. You can also stir in blueberries or other fruit and eat it as a breakfast porridge."

Almost oolong colored.<br />It's bitter.<br />There are stems as well as leaves.<br /><br />I bought this tea for its leaf size, price, and catechin content.  I'm pleased with this tea on at least the first two accounts.  My glass infuser kept on getting clogged with the cheap Sencha I was using; no inconvenience now.  As for the taste--this tea does not taste like Dragonwell, which I'd describe as slightly nutty flavored.  I got a superb, whole-leaf Dragonwell at Whole Foods; the only problem was that for 2 oz. the cost was about the same as for these 8 oz.<br /><br />I drink green tea for the catechin content, so I was somewhat concerned to see the tea coming out darker than expected after steeping.  If this is from fermentation and oxidation, then more of the catechins would have degraded than would have otherwise happened.  It was also bitter, which might be good if the bitterness was from a higher catechin content, but it could also be from more caffeine.  I don't want more caffeine.  And I know how to prepare this tea, and have successfully done so many times before with other brands.<br /><br />I would definitely consider buying this, but just be aware that ""Finest Grade"" may be hyperbole.<br /><br />-------------<br />Update:<br /><br />After drinking this tea daily (~ 2 rounded tsp., 5 infusions--it still has flavor), I started getting chronic headaches.  A dull pain in the left side of my head at multiple times during the day.  My armpits started to feel tender as well (which made me worry about my lymph nodes).  But what finally made me suspect the tea was my blueberry plant.  For around a year I have been using my leftover tea leaves to fertilize/mulch my plant.  Using the old sencha, as well as the Whole Foods dragonwell, I used to drink, the plant was healthy and made a large number of respectably-sized berries.  After adding my leftover Boston Tea, my 2+ year old plant has died.  Almost immediately (roughly two days) after adding the leaves to the soil, the blueberry plant leaves started to wilt and turn brown, then they shed.  Then the green part of the stems began to brown and dry.  My plant survived one month without watering, left in the dark in my bathtub, when I had to leave on a month-long trip and did not have anyone to plant-sit.<br /><br />I don't know if the tea was contaminated with pesticides or heavy metals or some other toxins, but I suspect so.  I AM NOT BUYING FROM BOSTON TEA EVER AGAIN!  If my hardy blueberry plant died after I had infused the leaves in water five times, how much toxin(s) did I ingest?"

Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage. The large, good quality, food storage containers are expensive, but it a one time cost. We also have a smaller container for general family use that we re-fill from the larger one.<br /><br />Overall:  I will definitely buy this again!"

Yes, two drops from this container equal one packet of splenda? And the container, supposedly, has 800 drops which is quite a statement that in true honesty I can not dispute because it would be really tedious to count every single little drop that pours out from the plastic dispenser. Okey, that aside let's go to the part in the title of my review where I also say: It works! I tried it in my regular daily coffee and must say the taste is very agreeable and I compare it mostly to Splenda (which has been the choice for the past year or more) and it certainly is as good, if not better. No weird taste that I been able to tell and with the added bonus that it has zero zero zero, I think it makes a strong case for consumption. Heard that Splenda does have carbs and calories compared with this EZ-Sweetz. So I like it and now I am trying to see how long will it last compared to the price it cost to buy it. And since it has no impact whatsoever in the glycemic index (don't I sound very informed?) that is a plus to be considered. Perhaps is not even expensive if it lasts for at least a month or more. I found the product by accident and intriguing from the gate go so I was running low on Splenda and instead of going back to Costco and purchasing another 1000 packets I bought this one. The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is for the value factor but in everything else that it is supposed to do, it does with shinning colors. Thankful to the fine, and I mean fine, reviewers in amazon which I have learned to value and trust their helpful opinions (most of the time, anywhoo) and who knew EZ-Sweetz (2oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle) existed in the free world?

If I can drink a tasty drink that is good for me, gives me energy, and makes me think of happy things, well, why wouldn't I? This one is all my grandmother and my father. Every Thanksgiving, my grandmother would let us drink cranberry juice mixed with ginger ale, and we felt so grown up. So grown up! It's still my preferred way of drinking cranberry juice, and when the cranberry ginger ale is released around the holidays, all I do is think of her. Her son, my father, is a ginger ale memory for me too, it's his favorite soft drink. Vernor's, if you've got it, or Schweppes, but Canada Dry will do in a pinch and make him think of me anyway. When my wife is ill, it's ginger ale, if you please, not lemon-lime anything. You know that old adage that girls always search for someone like their father? It's so true in my case...my wife and my father are amazingly alike. So when I spotted it on the Red Leaf tea website, I had to grab it for my campaign to get her to like ginger ale. Who knows, I might convert my dad with it when he comes up to visit next!<br /><br />This is wonderful. Ginger and I are not the best of buddies, but I'm coming around to it. This reminds me of a local ginger ale found only in Middle Kentucky called ""Ale-8-1"". It's full of ginger flavor, but in a very good way. If you get this one, don't be put off by the overwhelming ginger smell, it's not nearly as strong as it smells, which is a good thing to me. It would definitely be a matcha I reach for when I'm headed into work with an upset stomach, but need a pick me up. I don't think it's one I'll keep in stock, but it's not one I'll be actively trying to swap away either. I'm excited to try it with the cranberry. If you're familiar with ginger ale brands, it's more of a Vernor's than anything else. Lord have mercy, I spend way too much time with ginger ale, apparently. But if I can talk my Dad into trying matcha, this will definitely be the one I lead with. Who knows, my father in law greatly enjoyed the French Vanilla matcha from Red Leaf Tea, maybe my dad can be won over as well!"

It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing.

After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point."

(You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix!

It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse.

It is a failure in several ways. If you pop for even as short as 2 1/2 minutes, you will get about 50% good kernals, and the rest will be burnt. And I mean individual burnt kernals and a few solid masses of burnt kernals fused together! I have popped three bags so far and the result has been the same for all three. And I stood next to the microwave listening, as the product advises. At 2 1/2 minutes, there was still plenty of popping going on, but I stopped anyway.<br /><br />Then comes the challenge of opening the bag. The instructions are somewhat clear, but I was scratching my head on the first one or two that I popped. When you attempt to pull off the plastic bowl cover, you must pull very hard, and when you do that, the paper attached to the plastic tears and popcorn spills out. I tried pulling one side, but it didn't open cleanly, so I tried the other side, with the same result. I was determined not to use scissors because I didn't want greasy scissors that I would have to clean. I ended up on all three bags eating the popcorn with the plastic cover still partially attached. It was clear that any more attempts to remove the cover would have meant popcorn on the counter and floor.<br /><br />Finally, the picture on the box showing a nice buttery yellow bag of popcorn overflowing the top of the bowl is blatant false advertising. On all three bags I popped - at the proper time and temperature - the result was some yellow kernals, some grayish kernals (on their way to being burnt), and black, burnt kernals. And each time, the amount of popcorn was at least two inches below the top of the bowl. And many kernals were not popped.<br /><br />If an industrial design student presented this pop-up bowl for a class assignment, I think they would get an A minus for idea, and a D minus for execution. Didn't anyone at ConAgra foods bother to TEST this product before putting it on the market???"

I use an Aldi's brand $20 electric ice cream machine, where you have to freeze the mixing container for 24 hours, instead of having to use rock salt and ice. If I had it to do over, I would have bought a better and bigger machine. However, it serves it's purpose. It works well for me, if I mix up half the contents of this packet with mostly 1% milk, using heavy or light cream for the last 1/8th cup. I also add a little over 1 tsp. peppermint liquid flavoring. Once I added both the spearmint and the peppermint, which turned out good. If you get too much, just add more cream or milk or both. I also add about 1/8 to 1/4 cup, semi sweet chocolate chips. Don't add too many. I'd also recommend grinding up the chocolate chips first. The consistency of the ice cream after 20 minutes is like a thick sorbet or soft serve, but not hard like ice cream. You can find the mix at Walmart for about $3. One packet makes 2 quarts. Walmart also sells the flavoring cheaper than my local grocers.

What I didn't like was the new upgraded opaque white jar that Nutiva now uses for the coconut oil. I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar. This was not a problem with the previous jars. Nutiva should address this problem right away.

Well, they're just a chemical concoction designed to resemble a traditional soft drink and they do a pretty good job of it. Excess calories are eliminated, but we worried about the listed ingredients and the quality of the water. Are they safe? Well, most people would think so, but we had lingering doubts. We started drinking a variety of bottled waters and my wife found several that were acceptable to her.<br /><br />About a year ago, I discovered some cases of Crystal Geyser Sparkling Mineral Water at our local warehouse store. I grew to like them quite well. The bottles (18 ounces each) came in four lightly flavored varieties and were carbonated. They suited my drinking tastes quite well. A chilled bottle is crisp and refreshing. Of the four flavors, my clear favorite was the Natural Lime Flavor. Delicious!

But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be ""Pasteurized"", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a ""light"" roasting.

The color is lighter, and it is less dense than normal food because it's truly just fillers.<br /><br />I give it a second extra star because my cat would willingly eat this food and didn't seem to mind a whole lot, but I switched her (50/50 at first) to Blue Buffalo, which has real food ingredients and which she actually does prefer."

It was like the flavor was too concentrated or too artificial. It also did not taste like sweet caramel and apple. I could barely taste the caramel and I wasn't sure if I could make out apple either. It was just... odd. Second time I ate one I ate it in layers and figured out what was going on. The layers of chocolate and caramel taste like the original Milky Way. The nougat layer tastes spicy, kind of like fake cinnamon. It is so overwhelming it's hard to taste any apple. It's what I would imagine biting into a apple cinnamon candle would taste like. If they would have just added some natural apple flavor to the nougat, maybe add some extra caramel, and left out the spice I think this would have been a great idea. I hope they reformulate this and try making these again next year because Caramel Apple Milky Way's have so much potential."

I use the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014CVEH6"">Melitta Ready Set Joe Single Cup Coffee Brewer</a>. The first cup of coffee I made with this was very weak. By dropping the bag directly into the coffee and swishing it around tea bag style, I was able to get a stronger flavor. For my second cup, I just cut open the pod, dumped in the grounds and only let it drip until the color started to lighten. That made for a good cup of coffee.<br /><br />The Marley One Love coffee is an Ethipian Yirgacheffe, which is supposed to be a pretty reputable bean, and it delivers a good coffee. Properly prepared, it is full bodied, with only a slight hint of bitterness - much better than some other highly recommended coffees that I've tried. And the amount of coffee in the packet is just right for a strong standard cup of coffee if you prepare it right - only dripping through until the drip starts to get light. However, it sounds like some people using standard pod coffee makers are getting week coffee and my experience with my first cup indicates the water goes through the pod casing too fast, not giving the grounds a chance to get truly wet so that the water drips through them too quickly and doesn't carry enough of the flavor.

They're dense and gummy, and while the chocolate flavor is nice, the cherry flavor is so subtle that it's hardly noticeable.  There aren't any recognizable chunks of walnut, either.

He's primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I've turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn't know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it.

He's been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP.

The effort to make a single glass of freshly brewed iced tea is sufficiently daunting that I was never inspired to do it.  I'm not a fan of the bottled or instant versions and don't drink enough to warrant making a whole pitcher so I rarely drank iced tea at all even though I like it, particularly with lemon, until I discovered this stuff.  When I tried the sample pack of iced teas I received with an order of coffees, this lemon appealed to me the most and I've been reordering it ever since.  It suits my need for speed and ease and I find the flavor as good as fresh brewed.<br /><br />I use a pint Mason jar since I don't have a proper 16 oz glass that can withstand the initial heat.  It's a bit rustic, but it works fine.  You fill the glass with ice cubes and using one of the lower volume settings on your brewer, you let the hot tea fall directly into the ice filled glass.  Within a few seconds, it's chilled and ready to drink.<br /><br />Even though this is supposed to be pre-sweetened tea, it's not sweet enough for me and I add more sugar or Stevia.  To me it tastes fresh brewed with just the right amount of lemon and is done in seconds.  Since there are other teas I'm very fond of in K-cups, I tried the same method to make iced tea from those, but it doesn't work because they get too diluted.  This type is stronger and stands up to the extra dilution from the ice.  It provides me just the cooling pick-me-up I need during these super hot days.

Two, I had her at my parent's house and they have tile floor.  She banged it hard enough to break the plastic on the end piece (it unscrews on the bottom of the jug to let you put the treats in) - so I suggest not using it on tile floor and of course, quality supervision.<br /><br />I leave it out after she is done with it and she often returns to it during the day just to check and see if she missed anything!

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

It does make a nice, heart large cup of dark roast coffee, and $25 for 48 cups as the preorder price was outstanding. At that price, I don't think I've ever really seen better, but at the same time the brew doesn't seem quite as bold or earthy tasting as a cup of Green Mountain Dark Magic or Emeril's Big Easy Bold. I prefer a robust large cup on almost every brew, and I've realized that even the Ice Brew K-Cups are basically the same thing; a cup of coffee with extra grounds for brewing a small amount stronger...so I brew iced coffee with my Extra Bold k-cups. I did the math on weight, and these weigh in at just under a cup of Dark Magic or Sumatran Reserve, but I'd still say my favorites (by taste,) are the brands I've listed above or Tully's Italian or French Roast, Caribou Obsidian, Starbucks Dark Sumatra, or even Barista Prima French and Italian Roasts. The only other thing I can note about these is that the construction of the pods is about perfect; I didn't find any grinds in the box leaving me to believe there were no leaking pods. Almost all the pods had a little air puffing the foil out; which I've noticed a lot of the Keurig brands have flat foils, anyways, so I'm not even sure if it matters that much, although I've had grinds brew through on some of the flat pods. The only other difference I can mention is the  material of the foil top is different than Keurig brand pods; these are slightly harder and smoother (almost like a plastic or polymer,) but it doesn't seem to effect the brew process at all, and I didn't seem to get any grinds in my cup, so all in all it just doesn't matter to me. Still better than brewing through a regular coffee pot (even from fresh ground beans,) and I don't think I'll ever get tired of my Keurig coffee maker."

About 15 years ago, I happened to be shopping in my local gourmet food shoppe and spotted the now-familiar yellow box and decided ""what the heck, I'll give Valsuga Polenta a try"". From that day forward, my family and I became 'home-made-polenta-converts'...Valsuga consistently cooks up quickly, never lumps and always tastes sweet and fresh as a good polenta should. Sadly, my local supply dried up when the gourmet shoppe closed, but I was relieved to discover this product was offered on Amazon. The price is right, the product is fabulous: whats not to like?

There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than ""tea."" It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the ""Stix"" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix."

There are benefits to using the paste, however.<br /><br />There is not much alcohol in the paste, so it's great to use for a true vanilla flavor without the bitter aftertaste (keep in mind it does contain some extract so I'm guessing there is a minimal amount of alcohol in this).  This is certified kosher and is gluten free for anyone who might be interested in this info.  Also, the vanilla specks create visual flavor...after all, people taste first with their eyes.  I'll admit that I tend to overdo vanilla in my recipes, which is why the paste is so much better for recipes where the amount of liquid does matter (whipping creams, ice creams, creme brulee, etc.).<br /><br />Be aware that the paste isn't really a paste.  It's more like a syrup.  I've tried other Lorann products before (mostly their emulsions), so I'm glad that this product meets expectations.  It's comparable in price and potency to vanilla extracts, but I'll be using this paste almost exclusively for the reasons mentioned above."

I looked at the ingredients and noticed that in both the old and new product there is 150 mg of salt.  However, in the old ingredient list cinnamon came before salt. In the new ingredient list it comes after salt.  Thus, there is less cinnamon in the new cereal. You can really taste the difference.  The old recipe was much tastier.

You preheat the oven to 400 degrees and use either non-stick cooking spray on your muffin tin or use paper liners (I prefer the liners). To make the muffins you first loosen the dry mix by shaking the container sideways for 15 seconds. Next you add ½ cup of water to the container, replace the lid securely, turn the container over and shake vigorously for 60 seconds. After that, you pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them 2/3 full. Finally, you bake the muffins for 15 -17 minutes - after they are done baking let them cool in the pan for five minutes before removing them. The mix makes six muffins.<br /><br />I love the convenience of the Krusteaz One Step Muffin Mix. It is a quick solution to making muffins - all you need to do is add water so you don't have to worry about needing eggs or other ingredients. I also like the convenience of not having to use anything but the container and muffin pan - there is much less to clean up (which makes these muffins a perfect solution if you have unexpected visitors). The muffin container and lid (not the label) are both recyclable which is another bonus. The muffins come out nice and big - I was pleasantly surprised at how big they were. They also taste quite nice. When I make them I like to take them into work for a breakfast snack.<br /><br />Krusteaz One Step Muffin Mix is a quick easy way to make tasty muffins."

It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S.

The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.

I followed the instructions on the labels at first but found one important thing that the internet had suggested - you really do need to carefully wash these and strain the liquor if you're going to use it.  That's because there IS sand and grit on a few of the mushrooms.  (Overall they seem fairly clean, but I bit into a few grains of sand the first few times I used them because of skipping this step)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a FANTASTIC price and a great way to try these varieties if you never have since most aren't available in a lot of grocery stores.  My palate is inexperienced in most of these varieties but they seem good to me...nice big mushrooms that rehydrate well and are full of flavor.<br /><br />Finally, I did separately order a variety of other products from Earthy direct from their website.  They have a lot of stuff there (sauces, spices, gourmet treats) and their other products are fantastic thus far as well.  Watch prices though...although it's nice to get all your little treats in one place, some items really are cheaper here on Amazon.<br /><br />Customer service from Earthy is great as well...I would assume they'd treat Amazon orders as well as they treat their direct traffic.  I had an issue (my fault) with an order from their website and they were incredibly helpful fixing it."

We've used everything from microwave packages to Redenbacher loose popcorn, but I was looking for a cheaper way to get popcorn in bulk.  At the time I bought this popcorn, I got free shipping with Amazon's SuperSaver shipping.  My cost was .73 cents per pound.  As of today there's a shipping fee, which makes it quite a bit more expensive per pound.<br /><br />The popcorn arrived in a large ""feed bag"" without any outer box to protect it.  The bag was quite dirty from the UPS man's truck, but I poured it all into a food-grade 5 gallon bucket (available at Lowe's with a gasketed lid) and into a kitchen canister. The popcorn itself was clean and bug-free.<br /><br />I popped some for our weekly movie night, and everyone liked it.  The kernels pop up nice and fluffy, and there weren't many duds in the pan.  50 lbs. should last us a year or more, but we like to stock up on foods we enjoy anyway.<br /><br />Depending on whether or not you can get it with free shipping, this is a good deal on good quality popcorn.

I didn't have to cut the bag open with a scissors as you do with some brands. There was no cellophane tape holding the flap down as you see in some brands.

I've found I'm happiest and healthiest when I do this. I don't want to cut things out like oatmeal, I love oatmeal. It has many great benefits, isn't going to max out your blood sugar, and improves lipid numbers. But the majority of the store brands are loaded with various so called ""healthy grains"" along with the oats, sugar & sugar substitutes, and ingredients that have to be googled in order to understand what they are exactly. I don't want emulsifiers, fillers, preservatives, and binders, I just want some tasty oatmeal for breakfast. This isn't bad for gluten free and I can recognize everything listed on the ingredient panel. Again, the flavors are not as intense as other brands. Your ""taster"" has to adjust when you are recent to cutting down on sodium, sugars, etc. Eventually, you won't notice that the sweet in this isn't ridiculously cloyingly tart, and appreciate the subtlety of the flavors."

I am using it for supplemental grazing of horses, particularly to get small areas that are not permanently enclosed as pasture, but that get overgrown and/or delicious.<br /><br />I like it. Setup time, once you figure out the components, is about 15 minutes. It has all the pieces to make a very reasonable temporary electric corral - tape, posts, charger, ground, and gate hook.<br /><br />The 8 step-in posts are fairly standard: they have nice pointy metal stakes at the bottom that make them relatively easy to insert in moist ground. You probably can't get them into rock hard dry ground, but that's not a surprise. There are clips to give you flexibility in the fence height. But - you've probably seen them at the feed store - this kind of post is pretty short and will feel quite short compared to a normal horse fence.<br /><br />The kit is supposed to come with 200' of 1/2"" electric tape. Mine (as a Vine kit) only had 100'. This is enough for one very well behaved horse in a 25x25 square. The tape is not much of a visual barrier, especially with only one strand. This is not a fence I'd trust for a problem horse or for long unattended periods. 200' would be enough for either two strands or to have a 50x50 square and would be a much better value of time spent to grazing time. 50 x 50 is still quite small and the fence is still not substantial. It would be straightforward to add tape, but adding distance also increases the load on the charger.<br /><br />The product description says 4-5 horses. I would not feel safe doing that. Two quiet horses who know each other well and are already familiar with electric fence, maybe three for very brief periods, if you had the 50 x 50 and were nearby or had a secure outer fence. For grazing, three horses would have the area mowed in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />The charger - which uses 2 D batteries - has plenty of zap new. I was pleased by how easy it was to work with. It has its own spike, allowing you to set it up away from the fence.  The connections are long enough that you can put it out of nose range. The grounding nail was easy to set up and pull out.<br /><br />I like that it comes with a simple corner bracing system. You can set it up without the corner braces, depending upon how tight you like your fence and how stiff the ground is. But when you need the braces, you're glad to have the option.<br /><br />The tape comes on a handy small spinning jenny, which is designed to hang on the fence when it is installed. It's a simple thing, and thoughtfully done. It makes it easy to unroll the fence when setting up, and easy to reroll when putting it away. There is no problem doing the whole setup and takedown by yourself.<br /><br />The hook for the gate isn't quite a match for the brackets on the posts. A little bigger hook, or some sort of metal bracket, would be nice, to give a sense of a more secure latch. Still, you're counting on the fence never being touched, so it's not a big problem.<br /><br />The bag for the kit is amazing. Everything fits inside beautifully, with thoughtful pockets - even a special pocket for the instructions. It is easy to carry and extremely organized. I was very impressed to see the thought and effort put into the bag, which makes the kit much easier to use and deal with than just a pile of fence parts. The bag is big enough that there is room for extra items in both the long post compartment and the smaller bag section.<br /><br />This is a very nice and handy kit to have around if you have quiet horses that respect electric fence."

It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice."

A minor complaint is that an entire 20-bag roll doesn't fit into most standard-sized poop bag dispensers. However, it's not that much work to count and tear off a section of 10 bags and roll those up (start with the sealed end and work towards the open end).<br /><br />The one-star deduction is because these bags easily rip and puncture. Be careful when you are tearing each bag off as you can easily rip the bottom of the next bag on the roll. And don't even try to use that hole at the top of the bag; I'm not even sure what that hole is for. If you try to follow the diagram for closing the bag, the hole will tear open. Hopefully it will tear towards the top and not towards the bottom. Just tie a knot at the top and ignore that diagram. Also, if you drop a full bag on the sidewalk, it's very possible to put tiny holes in the bag when it hits the sand in the sidewalk cement. Hopefully a garbage can is nearby, because the bag is no longer odor-proof."

Sadly I was unable to get a starter going until now.  Thanks to Amazon I now have a wild yeast pure rye, as well as one started with a pinch of my wheat starter,  It says something about the freshness and quality that the starter was foaming after one day!  I have already made rye bread using a culture started from this flour, and no yeast was necessary :)<br /><br />Beyond that, I like that it is packed in small bags, as I have to store it in the freezer to combat the tropical humidity and pests.  I also like that it is 100% rye, not a mixture like so many others.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon :)  Without this service I would have the trappings of western civilization largely off limits but for when I travel.  i really appreciate having access to the foods I grew up with, and ingredients I need to cook what I like.... which is pretty much the only way to get those things here.

It was simply the best affordable coffee that could be drank on a daily basis. I was glad that Folgers has formulated there distinct coffee for the K-Cup. A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian  K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Update 8-7-2011<br />I have been drinking this now for well over 3 weeks now and I have to say it is now my new fav everyday coffee.

If you have a dog that is a picky eater then you might give this a try.<br /><br />As to the issues with a lot of the ingredients being secondary use or byproducts.<br />I am not a processed food expert, I do see that the number one ingredient is beef and I generally assume that animal food is made using safe secondary use food products which seems ok to me. We take the best cuts of beef and put them on the grill, next we grind up the next best to make our burgers, lunchmeat, and sausage, perhaps some of that same product as well as what is left goes to the animals we care for, should we just throw it all away instead? We pull oils and milk from soybeans to cook with and to make tofu. What happens to the fiber? We feed it to animals. Since we as humans eat whole soybeans I have to imagine that eating the fiber and remaining protein is not a terrible thing.<br /><br />Certainly all animals and humans have some allergies and digestive issues. Some people can't drink milk and some animals apparently don't do well with soy we don't seem to have an issue in our house. If your dog has issues and needs rice or something else then you should pick another food for them. If you have a healthy food that the dogs don't love, sprinkle a bit of this on top and perhaps you will have luck getting them to eat the less flavorful and perhaps healthier food with this addition. However this may be all you need to feed as according to Purina ""Animal feeding tests using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures substantiate that Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor and potato & green bean garnishes provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs."""

As a result the finish is extremely refined.<br /><br />I am basing this review on six mornings of 2 to 3 cups - the first cup with food and the remaining cup(s) consumed within an hour or so while working.  Additionally, I experimented with various grinding times and observed that that a finer grind resulted in a consistent and rounder cup.  I have used a drip maker to date and will experiment with a French press over the next few weeks."

The sweetness is rather like a mild brown sugar or a raw sugar and coconut sugar is not highly processed, whereas cane and beet sugar are highly processed.<br /><br />Coconut sugar consists primarily of sucrose which is chemically the same as cane or beet sugar, but it has a small amount of glucose and fructose. Attention, diabetics, it should be dealt with carefully, though it is said to be lower glycemic, with a glycemic index of 35. It is said to be diabetic-friendly, but I'd be sure to test it out and measure blood sugar levels, to make sure how your system reacts to this sweetener. (I am not diabetic, but I am always chary of any new sweetener that claims to be low glycemic or better for diabetics as each person can have quite different reactions.)<br /><br />In any case, this has more minerals, less processing and tastes great. It's a really great substitute for raw sugar or evaporated cane juice and excellent especially for Asian cooking.

I wish this had been around when I had my first daughter as I attempted to make her baby food, but gave up after a couple of weeks.  The Baby Brezza has made it possible as a working mom of two young girls to make my little one's meals that are easy to make and don't require constant monitoring.  You just chop up the veggies, select the steam time, press steam & blend, and walk away.  A little while later, the food is ready and there's only a few parts to clean up.  I can make her food 2-3 times a week with different ingredients and blend different veggie/fruit combinations.  I've tested sweet potato, apples, pears, peas, carrots, avocado (just blending), mango, peaches & plums and various different combinations. I envision this will be useful for many months and afterwards steam veggies for the entire family.  It will definitely more than pay for itself with the money saved!

I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!"

This tea delivers the immune boosting properties of organic Echinacea in a pleasant tasting blend of organic West Indian lemongrass leaf and organic spearmint.  Echinacea Plus has a serene and subtle lemon-mint flavor that is exceptionally comforting for colds, and soothing to scratchy raw throats.  Echinacea provides a slight tingle on the tongue due to the presence of alkylamides.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals recommends drinking 5-6 cups a days as soon as symptoms appear and then gradually reducing the dosage as symptoms improve.<br /><br />Numerous clinical studies have examined the effects of Echinacea.  Echinacea stimulates activity of cells that fight infection in our bodies and increases the number of these cells such as the white blood cells and lymphocytes. These immune cells attack bacteria, viruses and abnormal cells, including cancer.  Echinacea has a positive effect on wound  healing, lessens symptoms and speeds recovery from viruses.<br /><br />Echinacea also has anti-inflammatory properites which aids recovery from psoriasis and eczema and may help arthritis.  It also may increase resistance to candida, bronchitis and herpes and other infectious conditions.  Echinacea should not be used continually for any longer than 5-8 weeks."

I'm much more likely to purchase organic coffee in the first place. Combine that factor with the high quality Arabica beans and the convenience of these pods and you have a spectacular product. Also, partial proceeds of the coffee sales go toward youth soccer programs in the 'Kicks for cause foundation' that helps keep children on the playground and not in sweatshops, etc. Although these pods are not quite right for my home coffee pot (we have too many individuals who need a cup of coffee in the morning), they are fantastic for our various trips. I use these pods in place of the hotel coffee pods they provide in the room (hotel coffee is often not very good where we usually stay). The Marley Coffee pods are often far more tear resistant than the cheap hotel coffee pods. I've also used some of the packets as a unique addition to birthday gifts for friends and family (what great stocking stuffers they'll make for my coffee drinking family members). I also love to grab a  Marley Coffee pod for just a single cup of coffee in the evening if I'm going to be up late at night writing (which happens often). Another strategic place for these pods are the hiking backpacks. My husband, Tony McVay, and I can easily throw these in a small boiling pan of water if we are camping on the Mountains to Sea Trail or the Appalachian Trail on the weekends. The grains stay in the pod and haven't broke open in the pot thus far. I can't wait to share a few packets with a 'thru-hiker' on the Appalachian Trail. Imagine a weary hiker's delight when they treat themselves to a great cup of organic coffee just before hitting another long day on the trail! On that note, they are in a water-proof, light weight packet that fits easily in a backpack, purse and my husband's tool box. If he has a cup and a microwave available it is possible to brew a cup of coffee, although they're not exactly like tea bags. I can't wait to visit Marleycoffee.com to see what other flavors they have to offer. I truly believe this company is well on their way to winning over hearts and 'flavor fanatics' among devout coffee lovers.<br />Chrissy K. McVay"

It tastes like molasses, with a hint of black licorices and rum flavor.  I add it to my Oatmeal Raisin cookies to make them a bit chewier and a bit better.  It is messy to work with, but fun at the same time.  It's really really thick, like cold honey."

You know the stuff that you have to choke down because you know it's good for you. This stuff is EXCELLENT. Much like a kid whose parents give her gummy vitamins, I look forward to getting my fiber now. I put it on yogurt after exercise. I eat it as a television snack. I'll make up excuses to have it."
432234,B000LKTFHI,AU6N2GZQP5WE6,ven69,0/0,5.0,1339372800,Chili heaven,"Vegetarian or not, for canned chili this stuff is incredible.  Thick, rich texture, unlike a lot of other brands that tend to be a bit runny.  Very flavorful, and even better with a dash of cayenne pepper if you like your chili spicy, as I do.  Great as a stand-alone dish, on veggie dogs, with cornbread...you name it.  Excellent nutritional value, too -- high in protein and fiber, low in fat.  (Some take issue with the sodium content, but let's face it, most canned chilis and soups -- and prepared foods in general -- are loaded with it.)  I've had Hormel and Amy's; Chilli Man is far better.  To this vegetarian, it's chili heaven!"
61114,B000FA38ZY,A3MKON3VM0W1TH,Alan Beggerow,1/1,5.0,1321660800,Great cookie!,"Marshmallow on a cookie base, covered in chocolate. Whoever thought up Mallomars came up with a real winner! How can you go wrong with that combination, plus the expertise of Nabisco making them? The answer to that obvious question is ; you can't!  One of the best treats around, hands down! Very well packaged too. They were very fresh, something that is vital to any treat in general but especially one with marshmallow. Stale marshmallow is NOT good!  The only problem I had with these is that I could not leave them alone...until they were gone!"

I think it's amazing for cooking, putting on a baked potato, and my favorite, seasoning popcorn! It has a spicy kick with just a hint of sweetness, and lots of chile smoked flavor. The problem is that hint of sweetness. I use the Mrs. Dash blends because I'm on a low-sodium diet due to congestive heart failure, but I'm also by choice doing an all-natural diet, and many of the Mrs. Dash blends are a great way to season without guessing on measurements and such for spice blends, but there are some hidden culprits--for example, one of their blends has potassium chloride in it instead of salt. Well, this southwest chipotle blend is amazing in flavor, but it has SUGAR in it as one of the ingredients. Unfortunately, as much as I love it, the little bit of a sweet kick that I loved about this blend actually IS sugar and that means it's out for me. I don't eat sugar.<br /><br />But for diabetics, or those who are pre-diabetic an are watching their sugar, this product--that one wouldn't think would have sugar in it--clearly does list it in the ingredients. So be sure to check your labels on the Mrs. Dash products, because, while they are a great alternative to salt and can teach you to acclimate to more flavorful and healthier herb blends for seasoning your foods, sugar is processed and not great for you, so this flavor is one you'd have to skip.<br /><br />Otherwise, if sugar isn't an issue for you or your diet, I do highly recommend this seasoning. Seriously, try it on popcorn... amazing. I'm sad I can't have it any more!"

I like this much better than the long tough strips of wakame.  It blends up better, and is easier to work with in my opinion.  If I were to use in soup, I would think this version would be easier as well due to it being sliced so fine and small.  This is my second order, and won't be my last."

Well this batch I just got I had no problem draining the liquid!  It was a nice tough lid like in the old days of canned tuna.  Made draining so easy!  The tuna was nice and chunky inside.  Very solid, not mushy at all and I really couldn't tell that it was low sodium by the taste.  Tastes great!  I hope they will continue to use these lids!  Thanks Chicken of the Sea!"

I looked on Amazon and thanks to Subscribe & Save got 6 bottles for about $19 and free shipping.<br /><br />I am very pleased to have this available to me again. I have used some of it in my coffee, on the kid's pancakes, and substitute it measure for measure in recipes calling for corn syrup.

Forget Italian food from NYC, Chicago or San Francisco.  RI has the real thing and Fortuna's maintains the Sicilian tradition religiously.  All of their products are exceptional which is why they are more expensive.  Real Old World craftsmanship and taste."
